The phytosociological survey was carried out in three adjacent areas, all on calcareous soil, which correspond to different time intervals during which they have been left abandoned following a slash-and-burn agricultural perturbation. Early Phase (EP) with 15 years; Mid Phase (MP) with 25 years; and Late Phase (LP) with more than 36 years without clear-cut. The inventory indicated a continuum of tree species substitution, which is dominated by species of Leguminosae, especially Piptadenia gonoacantha (Mart.) J.F. Macbr. (Mimosoideae) in the earlier successional phases. Mycorrhizal colonization, estimated by the occurrence of the mycorrhizal structures in the tree species roots, diminished during the season with less rain (winter), and showed no significant differences between successional phases in the wet season (summer). Rather, the mycorrhizal colonization was correlated with occurrence of the tree’s successional status: being positively correlated with occurrence of pioneer species, and negatively correlated with late secondary species. Mycorrhizal colonization was also correlated negatively with soil organic matter and base saturation. Twenty five species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi belonging to four genera were identified. Six species were only identified to generic level. The species Glomus etunicatum Becker & Gerd. represented 10% of the total number of spores and occurred in all phases and seasons, while the genus Glomus represented 57% of the total of spores found in the rhizosphere. The diversity indices evaluated for the mycohrriza community were: H’ = 2.3, J’ = 0.97 and R = 4.12. These results are a contribution to the knowledge of The Atlantic Forest biodiversity and may have implications to support programs regarding rehabilitation of degraded vegetation in one of the World’s most threatened Biomes.","Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"YES",NA,NA,"Indonesia"

This study aimed at measuring fungal and bacterial biomass by epifluorescence microscopy and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) spore density in sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) fields under different managements. We collected soil samples of sugarcane fields managed with or without burning, with or without mechanized harvest, with or without application of vinasse and from nearby riparian native forest. The soil samples were collected at 10cm depth and storage at 4 degrees C until analysis. Fungal biomass varied from 25 to 37 mu g C g(-1) dry soil and bacterial from 178 to 263 mu g C g(-1) dry soil. The average fungal/bacterial ratio of fields was 0.14. The AMF spore density varied from 9 to 13 spores g(-1) dry soil. The different sugarcane managements did not affect AMF spore density. In general, there were no significant changes of microbial biomass with crop management and riparian forest. However, the sum of fungal and bacterial biomass measured by epifluorescence microscopy (i.e. 208-301 mu g C g(-1) dry soil) was very close to values of total soil microbial biomass observed in other studies with traditional techniques (e.g. fumigation-extraction). Therefore, determination of fungal/bacterial ratios by epifluorescence microscopy, associated with other parameters, appears to be a promising methodology to understand microbial functionality and nutrient cycling under different soil and crop managements.","Spain",NA,NA,"NO",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In addition to its influence on ecosystem processes and functions, the soil microbiome can interact with soilborne pathogens to facilitate or suppress plant disease development. Altering the microbiome composition to promote taxa that inhibit pathogenic activity has been suggested as a management strategy for forest diseases, including Armillaria root disease caused by Armillaria solidipes, which causes growth loss and mortality of conifers. These forest ecosystems are experiencing increased wildfire burn severity that could influenceA. solidipes activity and interactions of the soil microbiome with Armillaria root disease. In this research, we examine changes to the soil microbiome following three levels of burn severity in a coniferous forest in northern Idaho, United States, where Armillaria root disease is prevalent. We further determine how these changes correspond to the soil microbiomes associated with the pathogen A. solidipes, and a putatively beneficial species, A. altimontana. At 15-months post-fire, we found significant differences in richness and diversity between bacterial communities associated with unburned and burned areas, yet no significant changes to these metrics were found in fungal communities following fire. However, both bacterial and fungal communities showed compositional changes associated with burn severity, including microbial taxa with altered relative abundance. Further, significant differences in the relative abundance of certain microbial taxa in communities associated with the three burn severity levels overlapped with taxa associated with various Armillaria spp. Following severe burn, we observed a decreased relative abundance of beneficial ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with the microbial communities of A. altimontana, which may contribute to the antagonistic activity of this soil microbial community. Additionally, A. solidipes and associated microbial taxa were found to dominate following high-severity burns, suggesting that severe fires provide suitable environmental conditions for these species. Overall, our results suggest that shifts in the soil microbiome and an associated increase in the activity of A. solidipes following high-severity burns in similar conifer forests may result in priority areas for monitoring and proactive management of Armillaria root disease.","Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The biomass was determined from a phytosociological inventory (1 ha) and distributed between two categories: (1) grassy-woody, composed of herbs+lichens (Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Eriocaulaceae, Cladonia spp), Bromeliaceae, seedlings, fine and coarse litter and, (2) woody, composed of trees and bushes. The grassy-woody category was estimated by the direct method (cutting and weighing) in 10 1-m² plots, taking advantage of transects of the inventory. The category woody was estimated by the indirect method cutting 98 individuals of different species and diameters. A model was generated to express the relationship among total dry above-ground biomass (kg), base circumference (cm) and total height (m) for the individuals in this category. The equation was applied to the 3,966 ind.ha-1 observed in the inventory. The total biomass was estimated at 15.91 t.ha-1, of which 2.20 ± 0.23 t.ha-1 (13.8%) was in the grassy-woody category and 13.70 ± 7.13 t.ha-1 (86.2%) in woody category. The tree species with the highest biomass was Humiria balsamifera (Aubl.) St. Hill. (8.43 t.ha-1), followed by Pagamea guianensis Aubl. (1.14 t.ha-1). These results are important for refining the calculations of greenhouse-gas emissions from burning and decomposition of above-ground biomass in campina ecosystems in the Amazon region.","Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Post-fire soil amendments, such as woody mulch or biochar, are commonly used to stabilize soils and promote vegetation recovery, yet their effects on plant functional strategies and plant-microbe interactions remain poorly understood. Thirteen years after a high-severity wildfire in Colorado, we evaluated the impacts of these treatments on soil properties, microbial communities, and plant functional traits, including plant height, specific leaf area (SLA), and leaf dry matter content (LDMC). While statistical means comparisons showed limited treatment effects on vegetation composition or plant traits, random forest and exploratory mediation models revealed complex, non-linear, and indirect relationships among soil chemistry, microbial community composition, and plant responses. Notably, microbial community shifts and soil nutrient changes, especially in nitrogen form, emerged as key drivers of plant trait variation. Vaccinium scoparium responded more strongly to NH4+ and ectomycorrhizal fungi, while Oreochrysum parryi was associated with NO3 - and bacterial/archaeal diversity. Biochar increased soil carbon and microbial diversity, whereas mulch enhanced soil moisture and reduced NO3 - availability, leading to contrasting effects on microbial and plant responses. These findings demonstrate that post-fire soil amendments can have meaningful yet indirect impacts on plant resource use strategies and microbial dynamics, which may not be captured using conventional analyses. Our results highlight the value of trait-based approaches and integrative modeling for guiding restoration strategies aimed at enhancing ecosystem function and resilience in fire-affected landscapes.","Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The black truffle ( Tuber melanosporum Vittad.) is a highly valued ectomycorrhizal edible fungus. It exerts a strong allelopathic effect, creating a burnt area around the host tree that impacts soil biotic and abiotic properties, and likely affects soil functioning as well. This study investigated the influence of black truffle abundance on soil functions, at different seasons and truffle-producing systems. A regional field design was set up in black truffle productive plantations and forests across the natural distribution area of this fungus in Spain. Physico-chemical soil properties, potential soil enzymatic activities related with carbon, phosphorus and nitrogen cycling, and soil fungal richness and abundance were determined. Black truffle- producing forests generally exhibited lower enzymatic activity compared to plantations, except for chitinase. Besides greater soil enzymatic activity -mainly related with rapid carbon and nitrogen turnover- was observed in late spring than autumn, independently of the type of truffle producing system. Our findings revealed a significant negative impact of black truffle abundance on soil enzymatic activities, and particularly on those involved in carbon and nitrogen mobilisation. Besides the strong local site effect, other biotic and abiotic factors differently impacted soil functioning in truffle forests (Mg) and plantations (Ascomycetes richness, CaCO3, Na). These results offer insights into the ecology and functionality of host-truffle-soil interactions and provide valuable information for optimising management practices in black truffle plantations.","Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The experiment was carried out in a green house and incubator. A completely randomized experimental design of seven treatments and ten replications was used. The soybean cultivar was BRS 245RR; the treatments consisted of essential oils and methanol extracts of the genus Schinus terebinthifolius (Brazilian pepper tree) and Trichilia silvatica (quebra-machado, catigua-vermelho), the surfactant, Tween 80 (1% v/v), and water, as a control. The plants were sprayed with their respective treatments, and then artificially inoculated with the fungus about 24 hours later. The characteristics analysed were: number of leaflets per plot; chlorophyll index, plant height, intensity of the Asian soybean rust, number of leaflets with rust, number of leaflets with a burnt appearance. The plants sprayed with 5% (m/v) Schinus extract, and 1% (v/v) Schinus oil showed greater intensity of the disease compared to those sprayed with water.

This results because many parts of Australia have relatively old and highly weathered soil profiles compared to most other regions. However, interactions between soils and vegetation are very complex because soils result from weathering processes that are determined by substrate type, topography, climate and vegetation, as well as the relocation of materials by wind and water. In a global context, Australian soils in many habitats are highly infertile, with low availability of phosphorus, nitrogen and trace elements. These infertile soils are often linked to shrub-dominated ecosystems, where it is assumed that soil fertility is insufficient to support tree growth, but plant productivity is also severely limited by water availability in many habitats. Low soil nutrient supply is counteracted by plant adaptations to growth in infertile soils, as well as efficient nutrient cycling, especially after fire. In Australia the majority of plants have mycorrhizal associations that assist in nutrient uptake and this includes an exceptionally high diversity of plants with ectomycorrhizal associations, as well as plants with nitrogen fixing symbioses. However, nonmycorrhizal plants are also exceptionally diverse in many Australian vegetation types and include many species with specialised means of nutrition, including carnivores, parasites and cluster-rooted species.","Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Some ecosystems are fire-adapted, such as prairies which require cyclical burning to mitigate woody plant encroachment and reduce litter. While fire suppresses fire-sensitive fungi, pyrophilous fungi may continue providing ecosystem functions. Using litter bags, we measured the litter decomposition at three prairies with unburned and burned sections, and we used Illumina sequencing to examine litter communities. We hypothesized that (H1) decomposition would be higher at unburned sites than burned, (H2) increased decomposition at unburned sites would be correlated with higher overall saprotroph diversity, with a lower diversity in autoclaved samples, and (H3) pyrophilous fungal diversity would be higher at burned sites and overall higher in autoclaved samples. H1 was not supported; decomposition was unaffected by burn treatments. H2 and H3 were somewhat supported; saprotroph diversity was lowest in autoclaved litter at burned sites, but pyrophilous fungal diversity was the highest. Pyrophilous fungal diversity significantly contributed to litter decomposition rates, while saprotroph diversity did not. Our findings indicate that fire-adapted prairies host a suite of pyrophilous saprotrophic fungi, and that these fungi play a primary role in litter decomposition post-fire when other fire-sensitive fungal saprotrophs are less abundant.","Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although some Cistaceae are long-lived shrubs that grow to significant size, others are herbaceous annuals or short-lived plants. Thus, Cistaceae are atypical ECM hosts that are fundamentally different in their biology from trees that are the more typically studied ECM hosts. The Mediterranean region is the center of diversity for Cistaceae and the ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with Cistaceae hosts have primarily been studied in Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Mediterranean Cistaceae often host diverse communities of ECM fungi, but they also act as hosts for some ECM fungi that putatively show host-specificity or strong host preference for Cistaceae (including species of Delastria, Hebeloma, Terfezia, and Tirmania). The ECM associations of Cistaceae in North America, however, remain highly understudied. Here we use fungal DNA metabarcoding to document the ectomycorrhizal fungal communities associated with Crocanthemum and Lechea (Cistaceae) in open, fire-prone sandhill habitats in north Florida. At each site we also sampled nearby Pinus to determine whether small, herbaceous Cistaceae have specialized ECM fungi or whether they share their ECM fungal community with nearby pines. The ECM communities of Florida Cistaceae are dominated by Cenococcum (Ascomycota) and Russula (Basidiomycota) species but were also significantly associated with Delastria, an understudied genus of mostly truffle-like Pezizales (Ascomycota).

To explore how more severe fires may affect fungal diversity and community composition, we conducted an experimental summer fire in June 2019 at an experimental site that had been previously established in a pure stand of black pine (Pinus nigra Arn.) in 2016 in the Cuenca Mountains in Spain (Central-Eastern Spain).ResultsMetabarcode DNA analyses of soil samples collected in three blocks (with three plots sampled in unburned and burned areas per block) in spring 2020 revealed that total soil fungi richness and diversity were not affected by summer burning; although no significant, summer burning did have a contrary influence on the most dominant fungal trophic groups. The relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi was negatively affected by burning, whereas saprotrophic fungi were positively affected by burning. Fire also had a significant effect on the composition of the total community and when analyzed by the trophic group. Multilevel pattern analysis showed that ECM fungi were significantly correlated with unburned plots. Physicochemical analyses revealed that there were no changes in the main edaphic variables measured.ConclusionsThe application of fire under more critical summer conditions (out of typical prescribed fire weather windows in Europe) did not produce significant differences in the diversity of the fungal community, being ECM fungi more sensitive to heat than other trophic groups. However, the composition of the fungal community differed significantly between burned and unburned plots. Overall, burned plots showed an adaptation to fire with a rapid proliferation of several pyrophilous genera that are able to improve soil conditions, which would enhance post-fire regeneration of the stand.These pioneering results can inform managers in conducting controlled summer fires to surrogate low to medium surface fire in Pinus nigra stands, knowing that the fungal diversity of the ecosystem is not affected, and thus the key ecological role of these organisms is not significantly harmed.ConclusionsThe application of fire under more critical summer conditions (out of typical prescribed fire weather windows in Europe) did not produce significant differences in the diversity of the fungal community, being ECM fungi more sensitive to heat than other trophic groups.

In this project, eight institutions are investigating the ecological effects of wildfires and subsequent forest management strategies in pine forests (plantations) in Brandenburg (NE Germany), with the aim of formulating practical recommendations for managing fire-prone forests and the effective restoration of post-fire forest areas. We provide a brief overview of what is known about the effects of wildfire on abiotic and biotic parameters in temperate pine forests, as well as the effects of silvicultural treatments. To date, we know little about how different components of biodiversity are linked in post-fire forest ecosystems and how management affects their functioning. By describing the project, we illustrate the requirements for the implementation of such an applied research project. We emphasize the importance of the study design for dealing with interdisciplinary questions and for the quantitative synthesis of research results. The project comprises a set of standardised field plots in two wildfire areas covering different post-fire management options.Fifteen study sites were established, including two reference sites in unburned pine stands, each with ten study plots as replicates. In situ nitrogen mineralisation, litter decomposition tests and soil biological activity are used for soil biological characterisation. Microclimate data is measured continuously. Standing and lying dead wood and tree regeneration are recorded as key indicators of the success of forestry treatments. Further methods com-prise terrestrial laser scanning, remote sensing techniques as well as surveys of vegetation and above and below ground biomass. Identification of fruiting body-forming fungi, phytoparasites and ectomycorrhizal fungi is supported by marker gene sequencing. Faunistic indicators comprise predatory soil arthropods (pairs of emergence tents and soil traps), saproxylic beetles (flight traps and funnel traps), moths (automated window traps), mammals (camera traps), and breeding birds (visual and acoustic observation). We discuss the strengths and limitations of the project design. We are able to systematically capture short-term temporal shifts in parameters and trends in post-fire ecosystem development. Research in a real landscape with ongoing environmental changes and interventions pres-ents challenges for experimental design, data analysis and interpretation. The drivers of ecosystem development are rarely completely independent or perfectly balanced, and lack of replication is ine-vitable. The two fires did not occur in the same year and season, resulting in different initial conditions for the colonisation of the burned areas. Finally, a large part of one study area was again affected by a fire in 2022, which destroyed direct comparability with the other sites. Despite these obstacles the project has started to generate valuable results to address management and conservation challenges","Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Woody species that occur along this sharp gradient must adopt viable ecological strategies to deal with the contrasting environments of these ecosystems. For this, plants are challenged to efficiently coordinate the functioning of ecological strategy dimensions above- and below-ground. We tested hypotheses related to structural changes in vegetation and associated shifts in community-level trait patterns and ecological strategies during woody plant encroachment. We surveyed 60 permanent plots in forest-grassland mosaics at two different times (2012-2022) to obtain data on changes in vegetation structure, species composition, abundance and ecological strategies after 10 years without disturbance, capturing a gradient from open and woody plant-encroached grasslands to closed forests. An integrated functional approach was used to assess the different dimensions of plant trait variation, including 10 above- and below-ground traits, representing whole-plant, leaf, stem and root strategies. Woody plant encroachment led to a substantial increase in woody plant density in former grasslands, transforming their structure to resemble that of young forests. Interestingly, we found clear trade-offs between above- and below-ground traits among woody species. On the one hand, the species occurring in grassland had conservative leaves, a strategy for protection against high solar incidence, physical damage and drought, and had roots with a 'do-it-yourself' strategy, which ensures efficiency in the acquisition of nutrients and water in nutrient-limited soils, and had thick bark related to fire resistance. On the other hand, forest species were usually taller and had acquisitive leaves, indicating highly competitive ability in light-limited forests, whereas their roots had an 'outsourcing' strategy of resource uptake to mycorrhizal fungi in the nutrient-rich soils of forests. Synthesis: We advanced the current understanding of woody plant encroachment in grasslands by showing the underlying trait-based trade-offs that enable woody species to occur along the transition between forest and grassland through space and time. Importantly, we have shown how below-ground traits are important in explaining the species strategies, with a negative covariance between above- and below-ground. Our integrative trait-based approach will be helpful in better understanding and managing forest-grassland mosaics in southern Brazil and analogous patchy ecosystems around the world.Florestas e campos frequentemente ocorrem lado a lado na paisagem, formando um sistema mosaico complexo com condiçõ es ambientais contrastantes, mantido por diferentes feedbacks estabilizadores entre fogo e vegetaçã o.

In a mosaic of shifting cultivation, comprising two growing areas (conucos) and two 2-4 and 4-6 years deserted areas after being cultivated (fallow), and a little disturbed rain forest area, differences in fine root biomass (diameter <2mm), infective potential of soil and spore density of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were assessed. Roots and soil samples were collected at random in the first 15cm of depth. There was a significantly higher proportion of fine roots in the mantle root surface (mat) with respect to the mineral soil of the forest. Fine root biomass decreased markedly and the root mat was eliminated with the conversion of forest to conuco; however, within a six year fallow period an incipient root mat formed. AM colonization, number of spores and infective potential of the soil increased significantly in conuco and fallows with respect to the forest. The results show that the adverse effects that fire might have on the AMF were reversed during cultivation, possibly due to the planting of species that are highly susceptible to AM colonization.

However, their impacts on ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) remain unclear. A mega-fire burned an area of 8700 hectares in the Great Xing'an Mountains in 2000, creating a wide range of fire severity levels across various topographic positions. This provided a unique opportunity to explore the impacts of mixed-severity fire disturbance in boreal forests. We evaluated the effect pathways of wildfire and topography on aboveground multifunctionality (AEMF), soil multifunctionality (SEMF), and overall multifunctionality (OEMF). We found that high-severity burning resulted in lower AEMF, SEMF, and OEMF relative to low-severity burning. Topographic positions significantly influenced SEMF and OEMF, but not AEMF. Specifically, both lower SEMF and OEMF were observed on south-facing slopes. The structure equation model analysis showed that aspect had exerted strong indirect effects on AEMF, SEMF, and OEMF by affecting soil moisture and regenerated tree density (RTD). Fire severity had indirect negative effects on AEMF and OEMF by reducing RTD and on SEMF by reducing soil bacterial diversity and RTD. Our study elucidates the necessity of considering postfire site environments to better manage forest ecosystems and, in turn, promote the rapid recovery of boreal ecosystem functions.","Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, how much C is respired by soil microorganisms post-fire may depend on wildfire effects on particulate organic carbon (POC; mostly plant material accessible to microbes) and/or mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC; considered C protected by minerals from decomposers), meaning assessment of wildfire impacts on these pools is necessary to predict microbial decomposition rates and, thus, the fate of soil C. Here, we measured POC, MAOC, pyrogenic organic matter C, plant cover, extracellular enzyme activity (EEA), and microbial community abundance and composition 17 days, and 1, 3, and 4 years after the Holy Fire burned 94 km(2) of fire-adapted chaparral. The wildfire immediately decreased POC by 50% (from 51 +/- 21 to 26 +/- 6 g C kg(-1)) and MAOC by 33% (from 9.3 +/- 0.9 to 6.3 +/- 0.9 g C kg(-1)), consistent with MAOC being less vulnerable to loss than POC. POC decreased by another 38% 1 year post-fire, consistent with increases in microbial abundance and EEA suggesting increased microbial decomposition. Between 1 and 4 years after the fire, cover of the dominant shrub (Arctostaphylos glandulosa) increased from 3.9% +/- 1.6% to 16% +/- 5.4% (compared to 58% +/- 4.6% in unburned plots), marking the end of net soil C losses. Still, soil C did not increase between 1 and 4 years post-fire, suggesting plant C inputs did not outpace microbial respiration, a finding consistent with isotopically heavier C from microorganisms raising bulk soil delta C-13 values. As global changes favor increases in wildfire frequency and severity, C losses via combustion and decomposition may outpace plant C inputs during the first 4 years post-fire in chaparral, slowing the replenishment of soil C stocks.","Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

High-throughput sequencing and soil chemical analyses were conducted to assess fungal diversity, community composition, and soil nutrient properties. The results showed that fungal diversity was significantly higher in unburned soils compared to post-fire soils, with the most prominent changes in ectomycorrhizal fungi, which are crucial for pine regeneration. The fungal community composition differed markedly between the post-fire and unburned sites, with specific taxa such as Hygrocybe conica (Schaeff.) P. Kumm. and Solicoccozyma aeria (Saito) Yurkov dominating the post-fire environments. Despite this, the fungal richness did not significantly change over time (2-, 4-, or 6-years post-fire), suggesting the slow recovery of fungal communities in high-altitude environments. In addition to shifts in fungal biodiversity, the post-fire soils exhibited higher levels of available phosphorus, likely due to the conversion of organic phosphorus into soluble forms during combustion. However, the organic matter content remained unchanged. This study provided important insights into the long-term ecological impacts of forest fires on high-altitude P. heldreichii forests and underlined the importance of preserving unburned forest areas to maintain fungal biodiversity and support natural regeneration, as well as the potential need for active restoration strategies in fire-affected regions.","Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Spores were spatially distributed at four different levels of patchiness (1 patch, 4 patches, 8 patches and complete mixing) in 4 L pots (all pots received the same total amount of spores).

Studying the impacts of megafire on biodiversity and ecosystem services is crucial for strengthening resilience against this phenomenon. In this study, we evaluated the shortterm impact of Spain's largest recorded megafire on soil fungal diversity. We hypothesized: (i) fungal richness and abundance would be lower in burned plots than in control plots; (ii) saprotrophic species and ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) would exhibit divergent abundance trends; and (iii) indicator taxa associated with post-fire environments would be significantly linked to burned plots. To assess the validity of these hypotheses, nextgeneration sequencing techniques were applied. A total of 3025 operational taxonomic units were identified, of which 2188 were assigned at the genus or species level, spanning 18 phyla. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant phyla. Taxa were grouped into 20 trophic guilds, with saprotrophic fungi (67 %) and ECM fungi (18 %) dominating. Diversity indices considering relative abundances (Shannon and Pielou Evenness) were significantly lower in burned plots. Multivariate analyses revealed differences in fungal composition and functional groups. ECM taxa were significantly associated with unburned soils, whereas several saprotrophic groups were associated with burned plots, demonstrating divergent trends between these guilds in post-fire environments. Moreover, some pyrophilic taxa were identified as indicators of burned plots. Edible taxa were significantly affected, potentially threatening rural economies.

Nitrogen determination was performed by oxidation with perchloric acid; phosphorus was determined with nitric-perchloric extraction and colorimetric determination (spectrophotometric molybdovanadophosphoric acid method); potassium was determined by flame photometry; carbon, by muffle burning; sulphur, by gravimetry and calcium, magnesium, sodium, copper, iron, manganese and zinc, by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. According to the results obtained and as expected, it was verified that the element S was not detected in any of the kinds of eucalyptus analyzed, both for bark and wood; for wood, elements Mg, Na and Mn presented difference in contents among eucalyptus types analyzed. For bark, K2O, C, Cu and Mn showed different contents in function of eucalyptus type. Barks of eucalyptus types presented very high contents of Ca (77x), K (3,7x), Mg (39x), Na (2,5x), Mn (26x) e Fe (1,9x), compared to the corresponding woods (Ca was the prevailing element in bark). Ca, K, Mg and P were the prevailing elements in wood.","Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In line with identified recovery objectives of re-establishing populations within the species' former range, a founder population was translocated to a feral predator-free fenced exclosure within previously occupied habitat to the south of its current range. No published reference intervals for haematology and serum biochemistry exist for this species. Establishing reference intervals provides a valuable tool for health assessment of founder animals and investigations into population health and disease during ongoing monitoring of populations.ObjectiveTo develop reference intervals for haematology and serum biochemistry parameters in northern bettongs, Bettongia tropica.MethodsHaematological and serum biochemical reference intervals were determined from 39 healthy northern bettongs captured across the Lamb Range region of north Queensland. Routine haematological and biochemical parameters were analysed, including blood gases and lactate, which indicate metabolic changes associated with stress.ResultsHaematological and serum biochemical parameters were similar to those reported from other potoroids, except for haematocrit and serum protein, which were elevated. Stress parameters were within normal limits. Macropod herpesvirus and Toxoplasma gondii were not detected.ConclusionsTranslocated northern bettongs were in good general health, and data collected at the time of capture were sufficient to establish a preliminary reference interval for the species. This provides baseline information by which to monitor health and welfare of the translocated population, and will contribute to health monitoring of other extant populations.","Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we examined the effects of wildfire two years post-burn on soil carbon and fungal communities across a fire severity gradient in Douglas-fir forests in central British Columbia, Canada. We observed no significant differences in soil carbon or fungal community composition between low-severity and unburned stands. In contrast, high-severity wildfire resulted in a 49 % reduction in belowground carbon stocks (20.7 Mg Cha(-1)), a 91 % decline in ectomycorrhizal fungi, 5- to 27-fold increases in pathogenic fungi, and a proliferation of pyrophilous taxa compared to unburned stands. Carbon was lost primarily as light particulate organic matter, whereas impacts to mineral-associated carbon were muted. Pyrogenic carbon preferentially associated with the mineral fraction, modestly increasing (similar to 0.15 Mg Cha(-1)) the proportion of carbon resistant to decay in this stable fraction. Select helotialean (e.g. Phialocephala fortinii) and other pyrophilous taxa were well-correlated with pyrogenic carbon, suggesting this consortium is well-adapted to decompose persistent carbon and will likely continue to mineralize soil carbon even after high severity wildfire. The markedly higher abundance of pathogenic fungi and reduced ectomycorrhizal abundance in stands affected by high-severity fires pose risks to post-fire recovery, particularly if pathogen proliferation reduces conifer fitness. These results highlight that low-severity wildfires have comparatively muted impacts on soil carbon and fungal communities relative to high-severity wildfires, underscoring the importance of management strategies such as thinning and prescribed burns to mitigate the catastrophic effects of high-severity wildfires.","Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The second experiment investigated the combined effects of four types of charcoal: derived from oak wood, husks of buckwheat, rice and activated charcoal of larch wood, and two types of ECMF: Pt (Pisolithus tinctorius Pers.) and Ec (Pt + Rhizopogon spp. + Laccaria spp. + Scleroderma spp.) on the growth of Japanese larch seedlings. Our results show that growth was significantly stressed by large amounts charcoal applications. There were significant variations among the four types of charcoal on growth. We concluded that the addition of charcoal was the critical factor that influenced larch growth and ECMF formation. Rice charcoal and Ec stimulates the growth and nitrogen uptake of Japanese larch seedlings, thus the most suitable fungus and charcoal for practices is Ec-rice charcoal (1: 8 charcoal to basic soil).","Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In addition, a greenhouse experiment was performed to determine the relative mycorrhizal dependency (RMD) of this species. Four growth stages were selected, and roots and rhizosphere soil of five individuals from each stage were monitored during one year A seasonal pattern, but no difference in abandoned agriculture and mature forest were found in AM fungal activity. Soil moisture, spores per gram of soil, and percentage of root colonization were not correlated during this year. Root colonization was highest at both sites during the wet season, but was equally high during one dry season observation in the abandoned milpa. Spore density was highest during the dry season. The RMD ranged from 7.8 to 54.9%, with greater biomass of mycorrhizal than non-mycorrhizal plants using P solutions that mimicked field soil concentrations. This suggests that this slow-growing palm is highly dependent on mycorrhizal fungi in local soils and maintains relatively high AM activity even during the dry season. Culture of this slow-growing, understory palm for the rattan industry requires that soils be managed for high levels of AM fungi. The study showed that the standard local practice of shifting agriculture enables sufficient recovery of soil inoculum for growth of D. orthacanthos.","Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In order to understand the effect of fire, this work aimed to assess the abundance and diversity of fungal microorganisms in response to the use of fire and forest fires. Soil samples before and after burning were collected, with fungi isolated by the plating method, then quantified by counting the collony-forming units (CFU g(-1)) and identified at the gender level. The average CFU g(-1) did not present a significant difference between the evaluated fire regimes, however, there was a significant difference (p<0.05) for diversity, and the two years of fires caused less gender diversity. The genders Aspergillus and Penicillium were present in all sampled areas, with higher CFU g(-1) values, whereas genders Mucor and Rhizopus exhibited the lowest values. The average colony-forming unit (CFU g(-1)) and diversity before and after prescribed burning differed statistically (p < 0.05), while the average CFU g(-1) had a reduction and diversity showed an increase after the passage of fire in all areas evaluated. The greatest reduction in the average CFU g(-1) occurred for the month of July. Pearson's correlation coefficient values obtained demonstrated a significant negative correlation between average CFU g(-1), diversity and temperature (r = 0.70; r = -0.98 and p < 0.05). The diversity variable presented negative correlation with temperature, precipitation and relative humidity (r = -0.56; r = -0.86 and p < 0.05), thus indicating that there was a direct influence of these variables on the abundance and diversity of soil fungi.

One potential mitigation approach is a growth strategy shift mediated by intraspecific trait variation. We evaluated potential stress-induced shifts in two growth strategies across six common Florida scrub shrub species in two major groups, oaks (Quercus spp., Fagaceae) and heaths (Ericaceae), along an elevational stress gradient. The acquisitive-conservative gradient explains how plants invest in aboveground tissues to photosynthesize more, while the collaboration gradient explains how plants attain belowground resources using a 'do-it-yourself' strategy or collaboratively 'outsourcing' with mutualistic mycorrhizal fungi. We expected high-stress environments to shift species towards conservative growth with increased symbiont collaboration compared to low-stress environments. For each species, we measured a suite of aboveground (all species) and belowground (oaks only) plant functional traits in two or more different habitats along an elevational stress gradient. Aboveground traits (leaf circularity and stomatal density) significantly decreased with stress across all species analyzed, suggesting a shift to a more conservative strategy. Belowground oak traits showed significant support for a shift to more collaboration with stress, with decreases in specific root length and increases in ectomycorrhizal tip density with stress. Overall, we found that oak and heath shrubs showed limited support for shifting to a conservative strategy with stress and relatively strong support for the oaks to shift to a more collaborative strategy. These findings advance our broader knowledge of how oak and heath species cope with environmental stress via shifting growth strategies.","Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We aimed to analyze how large wildfires alter the capacity of fire-prone Mediterranean ecosystems dominated by Pinus pinaster Ait. to deliver the provisioning ecosystem service of mushroom production throughout the post-fire succession. We assessed this at early (<10 years), medium (10-20 years), and late (>20 years) stages after fire, compared to an unburned forest. Our results evidenced that large wildfires significantly reduced the capacity of these forests to provide mushroom harvesting opportunities. This adverse effect was most pronounced in the first few years after wildfire but persisted even after 20 years of post-fire succession. The total fungal species richness, abundance, diversity, and productivity at the post-fire successional stages remained lower than in the unburned forest, failing to reach their pre-fire levels even after two decades. However, the presence of commercially valuable edible fungal species, along with their species richness and productivity, began to recover in the medium and late stages after fire. In the immediate aftermath of the fire, saprotrophic fungal species dominated, while mycorrhizal species became more prevalent during the medium and late stages of secondary succession. Additionally, the abundance and productivity of mycorrhizal species in the late succession stage approached those found in the unburned forest. Soil pH and biochemical variables (microbial biomass C and beta-glucosidase enzymatic activity) were key drivers of changes in species composition along the successional stages. This knowledge is essential to guide management solutions aimed at reducing ecosystem service loss and increasing resilience to the new scenario of extreme large wildfire events at shorter fire-free intervals, especially in southern Europe.","Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, some indexes are based on the simple average of the environmental indicators (EIs) and ecosystem functions (EFs), which do not consider the ecosystem complexity and mutual relationships among the composing variables. In order to overcome these limitations, this study proposes a new method that modifies the ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) index proposed by Maestre et al. (2012) on Science (hereafter original EMF). From a theoretical point of view, this index (weighted EMF index or WEMF), which is based on the Principal Component Analysis, retains only the most influential EIs on EMF, and discards the EFs with lower environmental and statistical significance. Moreover, the method can take into account the combined effects of some EIs that synergistically drive the ecosystem functions, and estimates the quantitative influence of each EF on the ecosystem multifunctionality. The application of the WEMF to a forest ecosystem of Central Eastern Spain affected by a wildfire and then subjected to post-fire management (mulching with wood chips or wheat straw) has shown that: i) the original EMF index gives non-significant differences in ecosystem multifunctionality among the experimented soil conditions, which contrasts evidence from the literature; and ii) the WEMF captures the severe disturbance due to wildfire on ecosystem multifunctionality compared to the unburned sites, giving lower importance to those EFs that marginally affect the EMF. Despite the encouraging validation attempt, the results of this study should be considered preliminary for a wider applicability of the WEMF in other environmental contexts.","Spain",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
