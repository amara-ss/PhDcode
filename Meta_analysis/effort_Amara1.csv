A lack of successful conifer regeneration has often been noted following timber harvest, which may be driven by competitive interactions between tree seedlings and understory plants. The proposed research will assess the role of tamarack (Larix laricina) in mediating the successional trajectory of peatland forests. Specifically, we hypothesize that the presence of tamarack favors the recruitment of black spruce (Picea mariana) through shared interactions with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi and suppression of ericaceous shrub growth. We will use a combination of manipulative field- and greenhouse-based experiments to quantify the effects of tamarack on spruce recruitment. ECM fungal communities associated with both tree species in pre- and post-fire settings will also be quantified using DNA-based techniques. The research will involve collaboration between UM faculty in the departments of Plant Biology and Forest Resources, interactions with Minnesota DNR staff, and training of a junior scientist and three undergraduate students. Collectively, the results of the proposed work will have significant value for land managers interested in both tree production as well as diversity conservation.","YES",NA,"YES","NO","NA","NO INFO","NO",NA,NA,NA,"successional dynamics in peatland forests is tamarack a key mediator of postdisturbance forest regeneration"

These fungi provide mineral nutrients to the trees in exchange for sugars, and trees require them for growth and survival.  Following severe disturbance such as forest fires or logging, trees need to reestablish their relationships with mycorrhizal fungi in order to survive.  Prior work has shown that these fungi arrive in an ordered sequence, or ""succession"", after such disturbances.  A new model is proposed to explain this observed pattern through differences in spore dispersal and competitive interactions among mycorrhizal fungi. Four key predictions of this model concerning limitations to aerial spore dispersal and effect of tree root density on fungal competition will be tested through a combination of field sampling and manipulative growth-chamber experiments.  The broader impacts of this work are that it will help us understand an essential biotic process necessary for tree establishment, and will build a foundation of basic ecological knowledge for an important group of understudied organisms.  Training of graduate and undergraduate students will be an important component of this research. In addition this work takes advantage of its location within Point Reyes National Seashore by feeding back into management decisions within the park and through outreach efforts directed towards public education.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"collaborative research dispersal limitation as a primary factor in determining ectomycorrhizal community structure"
3,"Amara","not vetted",275,NA,"Causes and Consequences of Succession in Mycorrhizal Fungus Communities",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2006,"Mycorrhizal fungi are ubiquitous and influential symbionts of most terrestrial plants, and their communities have been observed to replace each other over time in predictable successional order. Ecologists have no understanding how successional suites of mycorrhizal fungi differ functionally or how changes in functional traits relate to effects of mycorrhizae on plants.  Changes in the conditions of such an important symbiosis must have broad consequences for plant community and ecosystem-level dynamics. Thus, establishing an experimental and theoretical basis for understanding consequences and causes of trait variation in distinct, successional mycorrhizal communities is the central theme of the work proposed.<br/><br/>Coastal California pine forests harbor the best-studied examples of mycorrhizal succession in the world. In them a very different suite of mycorrhizal species colonize seedlings in burned areas and open dunes compared to mature forest settings, where seedlings are linked to adult trees in common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs). Experiments have shown that recruiting seedlings in forests respond very differently to these two guilds of mycorrhizal fungi; however, ecologists do not understand why these ectomycorrhizal fungal communities change over time, or how successive functional traits of successive fungi relate to their effects on plants.  Growth chamber experiments, along with the results of a three-year field experiment in a coastal California Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) forest, wil establish  differences in the mechanisms by which early- and late-stage fungi influence seedling performance in the forest understorey.<br/><br/>The proposed work will have broad implications for conservation and silviculture. In its native range of California and Mexico, Monterey pine is limited to five small populations, some of which are at risk of extinction. Outside this range, it is one of the most widely planted timber species in the world, covering millions of acres on multiple continents. As an exotic, it is both a valuable commodity that preempts the need to harvest native timber and an aggressive invader, often naturalizing in ecosystems.

Most of the research will be conducted at Pt. Reyes National Seashore in naturally regenerating Bishop pine forests.

5,"Amara","not vetted",397,NA,"The mycorrhizal hyphosphere: a key driver of biogeochemical cycles?",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2007,"Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels have been rising steadily since the Industrial Revolution mainly as a consequence of human activity. Increased CO2 levels result in more heat absorbed from the sun thus contributing to global warming or 'the greenhouse effect'. This in turn has serious consequences for life on earth with loss of biodiversity, melting glaciers, forest fires and fatal heat waves. One of the major causes of increased CO2 levels is the burning of fossil fuels rapidly releasing carbon that has been stored for centuries back into the atmosphere. In order to cut our use of fossil fuels we can grow crops for energy. The large-scale production of such crops will dramatically alter the agricultural landscape. Energy (or 'biomass') crops are 'carbon neutral'; when burned to generate electricity they only release the same amount of CO2 back into the atmosphere as they fixed. Thus no 'extra' CO2 is released into the atmosphere. Energy crops include tree species such as Willow and Poplar. The roots of these plant species form symbiotic associations with mycorrhizal fungi naturally present in the soil and the term mycorrhizal literally means 'fungus-root'. Of the seven different types of mycorrhizal associations the two most important types are the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) which forms on tree species, and the arbuscular mycorrhizal association (AM), which forms mainly with herbaceous species. While most plants only form one type of association, both Willow and Poplar are unusual in that they can form both ectomycorrhizal or arbuscular mycorrhizal associations. Associations with mycorrhizal fungi can have direct benefits to the plant through increased growth, enhanced nutrient capture and disease suppression. In return, the mycorrhizal fungus obtains a supply of carbon from the host plant which helps it grow and produce an extensive mycelium external to the root. Plants influence the soil immediately surrounding their roots (called the 'rhizosphere') due to the presence of the growing root and as a result of compounds released from the root into the soil. Most of these compounds lost from the root through a passive process called 'exudation', are of low molecular weight and include amino acids, simple sugars and organic acids. These compounds are an ideal substrate for the microbial community; hence microbial populations are always higher in the rhizosphere compared to the bulk soil (i.e. soil not containing roots). Colonisation of roots by mycorrhizal fungi modifies the quantity and quality of compounds released from the roots but it is unknown to what extent the fungus actually contribute to the amount and types of compounds released. Moreover, in mycorrhizal plants, the external phase of the fungus (rather than the root) is the main zone of contact with the soil thus exudation of compounds from the hyphae may also influence microbial activities in the 'hyphosphere'. There is some evidence that ECM fungi can exude simple compounds but much less information on AM fungi although they are believed to improve soil structure by release of compounds from their hyphae. Thus, in this study we will examine to what extent ECM and AM fungi influence their surrounding environment. We will determine how much carbon flows to the fungus from the plant by using the carbon isotopes 14C (which is a radioactive isotope but very sensitive and from which we can obtain images of 14C flow through the plant to the fungus) and 13C (a stable hence non harmful isotope of C). We will also determine what types of compounds are exuded from the fungi by chemical analysis and by using biosensor microorganisms which can report back (via light omission) on the compounds released and the sites of release along the hyphae using a new approach called nanoSIMS. The influence of this hyphal exudation on a key soil process, denitrification, which results in a loss of N and which is also of environmental as well as economic concern will be quantified.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"the mycorrhizal hyphosphere a key driver of biogeochemical cycles"

The recent Paris Climate Conference, the results of which, after two weeks of negotiations, delegations of 196 countries unanimously adopted the new agreement the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (Adoption of the Paris agreement, 2015) confirms the very high relevance of evaluation of contribution of forests to the carbon cycle regulation. However, there are still many uncertainties in the estimates of the parameters of the carbon cycle, including soil carbon in forests at different stages of succession. Russia accounts for 22% of the world's forest resources and more than half of the world's boreal forests. The whole mosaic of successional stages of the boreal forest is presented in Russia. However, research results on the basis of which it is possible to draw certain conclusions about the relationships between the forest succession status of the different forest types and soil organic carbon accumulation and dynamics are not sufficient. Since the proportion of the soil organic carbon out of all carbon pool in the old-growth forests could achieve 90% (Johnsson et al, 2010), these issues would make a significant contribution to the assessment of the role of forest soils in regulating climate and development of sustainable forest management. The project aims to assess the links between the soil carbon reserve and successional status of forests, role of mycorrhizal fungi in soil carbon stock of forests in different stages of succession of coniferous-deciduous forests< and leaching of dissolved organic carbons from the soil of coniferous and coniferous- deciduous forests at the different stages of successions. There are three main objectives: 1- evaluation of carbon stocks in forest soils of different types at different stages of development and successional dynamics model predictions of carbon stocks in the post-fire and post-plowing successions of forests; 2- assess the role of mycorrhizal fungi in soil carbon stock of forests in different stages of succession; 3- evaluation of leaching and losses of the dissolved organic carbon, including black carbon, with soil waters. Scientific novelty lem is in assessment of the relationships between the successional status of forests and soil carbon accumulation and dynamics in forests at the northern tree line, in northern, middle taiga and mixed coniferous-deciduous forests, taking into account vertical (within the profile) and horizontal (within- the- biogeocoensis, between the biogeocoenoses, landscape) variability. The contribution of ectomycorrhizal fungi into the soil carbon stock in lowland coniferous-deciduous forests at different stages of post-fire successions will be evaluated. The long-term (over 20 years) assessment of the dynamics of leaching of dissolved organic carbon from the soil in forests at the northern tree line on the different stages of successions will be given. The model forecast of the dynamics of carbon stock in forest soils of different types at different stages of post-fire and post-plowing successions, taking into account different scenarios of climate change, will be done.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"the accumulation of carbon in forest soils and forest succession status"

Through intimate connections they form with tree roots, they trade essential nutrients obtained from the soil for carbon acquired by trees through photosynthesis. Tree growth in nutrient limited forests can be greatly enhanced in this manner, making the ectomycorrhizal fungal community an important determinant of forest productivity.

Andrews LTER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1999,"This Microbial Observatory is dedicated to the study of bacteria and fungi central to biogeochemical processes of coniferous forest ecosystems associated with the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, located in the Cascade Mountains of Central Oregon. The research focuses on the functional diversity of microorganisms that perform nitrogen cycle processes because N is the most limiting nutrient to tree growth in this ecosystem.  Concentration is primarily on the processes that produce and consume NO3 - because of their pivotal role in supplying N for plant growth and because of the environmental importance of N losses to ground and surface waters as NO3 - or to the atmosphere as N2 O.  The functional diversity of specific enzymes that produce and consume NO3 - in soils located at specific sites at the Andrews where aspects of N-cycling have been shown to change in response to the influence of man (timber harvest, burning) or to natural successional events (actinorhizal to coniferous species transitions) will be examined.  The following objectives are being pursued: (1) To determine how the functional diversity of key N-cycling microorganisms changes during secondary succession following the clear cutting of old-growth coniferous forest; (2) To determine the influence of grassland meadow and coniferous vegetation on the functional diversity of key N- cycling microorganisms; (3) To determine how naturally high inputs of N from actinorhizal N2 -fixing symbioses affect the functional diversity of key N cycling microorganisms; and (4) To examine how the presence of ectomycorrhizal mats affects the functional diversity of key N cycling microorganisms.  The diversity of key N cycling microorganisms is being determined using methods based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  PCR primers will be selected that are  specific to genes that code for selected N cycling enzymes, concentrating on those processes that produce or consume NO3 -, such as NH3 monooxygenase, assimilatory NO3 - reductase, and dissimilatory NO2 - reductase. The diversity of the PCR products will be determined by separating them by size using gel electrophoresis either with terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP-PCR) or without (length heterogeneity or LH-PCR) digestion with restriction enzymes. These measures of functional diversity will be related to measurements of their respective process rates to examine whether there is a link between the types of functional enzymes and their functioning in the<br/>ecosystem.  If meaningful relationships among the process rates and the diversity of the enzyme systems that carry out these functions are found,  attempts will be made to sequence these genes, isolate the microorganisms representative of these functional groups, and characterize them by 16S rDNA sequencing.  Any isolates obtained will be maintained locally and made available to others by request. Sequences generated by this research will be deposited in GenBank.

Their significance has hitherto been studied only for vegetation destroyed over large areas, while in small areas of fire, i.e., microhabitats they are viewed as independent components of the community linked only to the substratum. In the present work, the following hypotheses were tested: (1) species structures of PM in microhabitats depend on the type of plant community, (2) PM form communities on a small scale which are similar in structure and function to analogous large scale communities. We studied 20 surfaces destroyed by illegal campfires in four natural plant communities: oak-hornbeam forest Tilio-Carpinetum (TC), lowland acidophilus beech forest Luzulo pilosae-Fagetum (LF), suboceanic pine forest Leucobryo-Pinetum (LP), and an initial-phase xerothermic grassland community on a transitional habitat (MH). TC and LF habitats were conspicuously more favourable for PM than LP and MH. In TC and LF fire leads to significant loss of mycorrhizae in the upper layer of leaf litter. This provides a development opportunity for ectomycorrhizal PM species which, having little competition, substitute for the destroyed fragments of mycorrhizal networks. In LP and MH fire over a small surface does not destroy more deeply located mycorrhizal associations. Another important factor for PM influencing the quality of environment is the fertility of soil: highest in TC, intermediate in LF and lowest in LP and MH. The results casts doubt on the concept that PM are only synusia linked to the substratum (burnt wood). PM growing in microhabitats constitute an important group of organisms which facilitate rapid regeneration of plant community fragments destroyed by fire. (c) 2012 The British Mycological Society.

Additionally, we investigated myxomycetes in corresponding unburned stands. All studied sites (unburned and burned) bore rather different myxomycete assemblages but the disparities of the species compositions between both burn types were more pronounced showing that fire severity had stronger impact on myxomycete species composition than the pre-fire stand type. Analysis of myxomycete assemblages (including the results from field collections, bark and litter cultures) showed that surface fire sites bore the highest number of post-fire species compared to crown fire and unburned sites. Dynamic annual changes in species composition were observed in all studied sites but only crown fire plots showed a clear chronosequence of post-fire myxomycete assemblages. Fire impact promoted establishment and/or sporulation of myxomycete species that are rare in similar unburned stands, or are usually confined to other types of forests and substrata. In addition, individual myxomycete species tended to switch substratum usage during the course of vegetation succession, with a final return to their usual substrata.

In this context, forest mycological management of wild mushrooms has emerged a research field and is developing rapidly with the objective to sustainably use and conserve mushrooms in multifunctional forests. Although the term 'mycosilviculture' was coined relatively recently, forest management of mycological resources and fungal silviculture began already in the 1980s. This study reviews the literature on the forest management of wild mycological resources with emphasis on studies in Spanish Mediterranean forests. The review covers some of the most important aspects of management, such as the diagnosis of mycological resources through inventory and sampling protocols, predictive models of mushroom yield, stand variables and mycosilvicultural practices that affect mushroom yield and fungal diversity. Finally, the potential of mycorrhizal applications for mycosilviculture is briefly discussed. Most of these studies have been based on carpophore inventories, and few have analyzed soil and air fungal biomass. The Mediterranean climate determines mushroom yields; so far, mushroom yields models have been developed mainly for Boletus gr. edulis and Lactarius gr. deliciosus species and for pine forest ecosystems. In the future, it will be necessary to adjust these models to new climatic conditions, and to investigate the complex interactions between different yield and/or fungal diversity factors, adjust the scale of study and fungus-host specificity. So far, few studies have been carried out on mycosilviculture in Mediterranean forests, addressing the effect of thinning and clearcutting on fungal communities; moreover, experiences of mycological management of shrublands, prescribed burning, management of woody debris or selective planting of mycorrhizal seedlings in forests are scarce. The need to study other Mediterranean forest ecosystems is pointed out.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"management of mushroom resources in spanish forests a review"

Higher temperatures could increase the activity of boreal decomposers and indirectly affect decomposition through other ecosystem feedbacks. For example, permafrost melting will likely alleviate constraints on microbial decomposition and lead to greater soil CO2 emissions. However, wet boreal ecosystems underlain by permafrost are often CH4 sources, and permafrost thaw could ultimately result in drier soils that consume CH4, thereby offsetting some of the greenhouse warming potential of soil CO2 emissions. Climate change is also likely to increase winter precipitation and snow depth in boreal regions, which may stimulate decomposition by moderating soil temperatures under the snowpack. As temperatures and evapotranspiration increase in the boreal zone, fires may become more frequent, leading to additional permafrost loss from burned ecosystems. Although post-fire decomposition could also increase due to higher soil temperatures, reductions in microbial biomass and activity may attenuate this response. Other feedbacks such as soil drying, increased nutrient mineralization, and plant species shifts are either weak or uncertain. We conclude that strong positive feedbacks to decomposition will likely depend on permafrost thaw, and that climate feedbacks will probably be weak or negative in boreal ecosystems without permafrost. However, warming manipulations should be conducted in a broader range of boreal systems to validate these predictions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

In the Andes Cordillera, Nothofagus pumilio is a native, fire-sensitive tree species that is completely excluded from severely burned areas. Therefore, it is of interest to evaluate whether there are differences in the microbial soil communities that could contribute to improve the recruitment of N. pumilio after a fire. We aimed at determining the diversity of soil bacteria and fungi associated with Nothofagus pumilio in old-growth forests affected by a moderate severity wildfire in the Andes Cordillera of south-central Chile in 2015. Methods Eight years after fire, soil samples were collected from selected N. pumilio rhizosphere and bulk soil in fire-affected areas, and were compared with those from unburned areas using a metabarcoding approach. Results We found that symbiotic microorganisms such as saprophytic, ectomycorrhizal fungi, ericoid mycorrhizal taxa and N-fixing bacteria were present with high abundances in the burned area. The most abundant bacterial genera were Mycobacterium, Rhodoplanes and Bryobacter. Meanwhile, Cortinarius and Penicillium were the most common fungal genera identified in burned and unburned sites. Conclusions Moderate severity wildfires in Nothofagus pumilio forests do not result in significantly different soil microbiomes eight years post-burn in either the rhizosphere or bulk soil, which could be key for N. pumilio establishment and survival after fire.

Using amplicon sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS1 region, we demonstrate that (i) burn severity is a strong driver of soil microbial community composition, (ii) logging and high severity burning substantially reduce the biomass and diversity of soil bacteria and fungi, and (iii) the impacts of logging and burning on soil microbial communities are largely restricted to the top 10 cm of soil, with weak impacts on the subsoil.

Prescribed burning is a commonly used forest management practice and there is evidence that single fire events can have an impact on soil fungal communities but little is known about the effects of repeated prescribed burning. We have used internal transcribed spacer (ITS) terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis to investigate the impacts of repeated prescribed burning every two or four years over a period of 30 years on soil basidiomycete communities in an Australian wet sclerophyll forest. Detrended correspondence analysis of ITST-RFLP profiles separated basidiomycete communities in unburned control plots from those in burned plots, with those burned every two years being the most different from controls. Burning had no effect on basidiomycete species richness, thus these differences appear to be due to changes in community structure. Basidiomycete communities in the unburned control plots were vertically stratified in the upper 20 cm of soil, but no evidence was found for stratification in the burned plots, suggesting that repeated prescribed burning results in more uniform basidiomycete communities.

When no cause was identified for hypereosinophilia we gave a therapeutic trial with diethylcarbamazine to the patients.An eosinophil count greater than or equal to 1000/mm(3) was recorded in 80% of 24 cases seen within 6 months; 55% of 46 cases seen 0-24 months; 54% of 18 cases seen 25-48 months and 21% of 25 cases seen more than 49 months of onset of symptoms: while the respective distribution of eosinophil count greater than or equal to 1500/mm(3) for similar periods were 66, 44, 27 and 21%.

The final stocking rates varied between 75 and 200 stems ha(-1) at Esk and between 250 and 400 stems ha(-1) at Herberton. The thinned plots were compared to un-thinned plots.

Leaf samples were collected from C. variegata and C. citriodora in Esk and Herberton respectively.Thinning did not change soil total C, total N, delta N-15 and inorganic N at either Esk or Herberton. However, at Esk, intensive thinning resulted in decreases in water soluble total N (WSTN). Foliar delta C-13 did not vary with respect to thinning whereas foliar delta N-15 values were more enriched in thinned areas than those of un-thinned plots. The stepwise linear regression indicated that both foliar total N and delta N-15 were explained mainly by soil TN and WSTN.Thinning did not change soil C and N most likely due to the retention of thinned materials on site and their incorporation into soil. Foliar delta C-13 was not thinning-dependent due to homeostatic maintenance of the ratio of intercellular to ambient CO2 concentrations during photosynthesis. In our study, soil N was not a limiting factor for foliar N, however, foliar N was mainly driven by WSTN which may foreshadow a possible N limitation in severely thinned plots in the long term.

We located our study within and surrounding the area of the McLure fire (August 2003). We hypothesized that disturbance would affect EMF community assembly due to reductions in fungal inoculum. Five treatments representing a range of disturbance severities were compared: high severity burn, low severity burn, screefed clearcut (manual removal of forest floor), clearcut, and undisturbed forest. EMF communities in the undisturbed forest were more complex than those in all disturbance treatments. However, aspects of community assembly varied with disturbance type, where the burn treatments had the simplest communities. After 4 months, regenerating seedlings in the burn treatments had the lowest colonization, but seedlings in all treatments were fully colonized within 1 year. EMF communities were similar among the four disturbance types, largely due to dominance of Wilcoxina throughout the study period. However, forest floor retention influenced community assembly as the EMF in the clearcut treatment, where forest floor was retained, had levels of diversity and richness comparable to the undisturbed forest. Overall, the results suggest that increasing forest floor disturbance can alter EMF community assembly in the first year of regeneration.

Despite recommendations for research on the role of the microsite environment for oak regeneration, very little is known about the interacting effects of fire, soil, and surrounding plant community on oak establishment. We collected undisturbed and burned soil in the aftermath of a wildfire in Great Smoky Mountains National Park and used amplicon sequencing to identify differences in composition of bacterial and fungal communities between unburned and burned soils. To assess the effects of plant community, fire-induced shifts in soil microbial communities, and their interaction we conducted a glasshouse experiment and grew Quercus velutina seedlings in factorial treatments of plant neighbor (oak vs. pine seedling) and soil burn status (unburned vs. burned soil). Fire reduced the diversity of plant pathogenic and saprotrophic fungi and reduced the relative abundance of plant pathogenic fungi. Fire did not affect soil bacterial communities. Shifts in soil fungal community composition enhanced oak seedling root growth, but the effect of the soil microbiome was mediated by plant neighbor interactions. Seedling root growth was negatively correlated with diversity of pathogenic fungi. Root growth was enhanced in burned soil relative to unburned soil, but only when growing with a pine seedling neighbor as opposed to an oak seedling neighbor.

Such understanding has become increasingly important in light of observed changes in disturbance regimes in recent years due to climate change.We used a greenhouse experiment to determine how soil inoculum collected from lodgepole pine stands undisturbed (control) or disturbed by fire, mountain pine beetle outbreak, logging and salvage logging affect pine seedling performance in western Canada. We first characterized whether fungal communities of seedling roots change as a function of inoculum source, and then determined whether changes in fungal community composition impact pine seedling performance (biomass and height).Root fungal communities of pine seedlings from logged and salvage logged disturbances differed from their respective paired controls, while soils from natural disturbances (fire and beetle outbreak) did not. Among disturbances, the pine root fungal communities of fire and salvage logged disturbances differed.In parallel to the root fungal communities, seedling performance also decreased when comparing logging and salvage logging disturbances to paired controls. Among disturbance treatments, seedlings from the salvage logged disturbance did not grow as big as seedlings inoculated with soils from burned forests.Synthesis and application. Our findings indicate that anthropogenic disturbances (logging and salvage logging) can have cross-generational impacts on pine seedling performance, through functional shifts in seedling root fungal community structure. Furthermore, the impacts of soil fungi on pine seedlings appear to be pronounced following salvage logging, stressing the importance of compound disturbance events.

Shoot biomasses and stem diameters of 4-year-old seedlings were recorded, and the fungal community associated with ectomycorrhizal (ECM) root tips from each seedling was profiled using molecular techniques. We found distinct assemblages of fungi associated with alder compared with those associated with the other tree species, making the formation of CMNs between them unlikely. However, among the spruce, aspen, and birch seedlings, there were many shared fungi (including members of the Pezoloma ericae [Hymenoscyphus ericae] species aggregate, Thelephora terrestris, and Russula spp.), raising the possibility that these regenerating seedlings may form interspecies CMNs. Distance between samples did not influence how similar ECM root tip-associated fungal communities were, and of the fungal groups identified, only one of them was more likely to be shared between seedlings that were closer together, suggesting that the majority of fungi surveyed did not have a clumped distribution across the small scale of this study.

The fungal ribotypes associated with larger seedlings were different between spruce, aspen, and birch, suggesting differential impacts of some host-fungus combinations.

Fire suppression is detrimental to these forests, and eventually destroys all old growth. The reintroduction of fire into degraded frequent-fire, old-growth forests, accompanied by appropriate thinning, can restore a balance to these ecosystems. Several areas require further research and study: 1) the ability of the understory to respond to restoration treatments, 2) the rate of ecosystem recovery following wildfires whose level of severity is beyond the historic or natural range of variation, 3) the effects of climate change, and 4) the role of the microbial community.

The first species in the region were described in 1844, but sequestrate fungi have been poorly documented until recent times. Regional diversity of sequestrate fungi is high in comparison to other parts of the world: for ascomycetes and basidiomycetes 83 genera and 294 species are currently known in Australia and 32 genera and 58 species in New Zealand. Only an estimated 12-23% of species are known for Australia and 25-30% for New Zealand. On that basis, between 1278-2450 species may occur in Australia and 193-232 in New Zealand. Centres of diversity for some groups of sequestrate fungi occur in the region, e.g. Russulaceae (five known genera, 68 species) and Cortinariaceae (eight genera, 33 species). Some other groups are less diverse than in the northern hemisphere, e.g. sequestrate Boletaceae (seven genera, 25 species). More than 35% of Australian sequestrate genera and 95% of species are endemic; for New Zealand about 45% of sequestrate genera and 80% of species are endemic. Australia and New Zealand share similarities in sequestrate fungi at generic level (11% of total) but do not share many of the same species (4% of total). Knowledge of biogeographical distributions is limited by incomplete taxonomic knowledge and insufficient collections. Some Gondwanan, Australasian and widespread/cosmopolitan patterns are evident. Some exotic sequestrate fungi have been recently introduced and some fungi indigenous to the region occur world-wide as exotics with eucalypt plantings. Within Australia and New Zealand, there is evidence that characteristic suites of fungi co-occur in different climatic and vegetation types. Mycorrhizas of Australian and New Zealand taxa have a range of morphological and physiological attributes relating to their effect on plants and broader roles in ecosystem nutrient cycling and health. Spores of sequestrate fungi are dispersed by a range of fauna. There are tripartite inter-dependent interactions between mycorrhizal plants, sequestrate fungi and native mammals and birds that use the fungi as food. Major environmental influences affecting the distribution, diversity and abundance of sequestrate fungi include climate, topography, soil, vegetation and animals. Imposed upon such influences are a range of natural and human-induced disturbance factors which alter habitat heterogeneity, e.g. fire, fragmentation and replacement of native vegetation and exotic organisms. Rare and endangered sequestrate fungi are likely to occur in Australia and New Zealand, but for most taxa there is insufficient data to determine rarity or commonality. In the face of poor knowledge, assemblage-based and habitat-based approaches are the most appropriate for conservation and management of sequestrate fungi.

While previous research efforts have focused on quantifying the impacts of fire on above-ground forest biodiversity, how microbial communities respond to fire is less understood, despite their functional significance. Here, we describe the effects of time since fire, fire frequency and their interaction on soil and leaf litter fungal and bacterial communities from the pyrodiverse, Eucalyptus pilularis forests of south-eastern Australia. Using structural equation models, we also elucidate how fire can influence these communities both directly and indirectly through biotic-abiotic interactions. Our results demonstrate that fire is a key driver of litter and soil bacterial and fungal communities, with effects most pronounced for soil fungal communities. Notably, recently burnt forest hosted lower abundances of symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi and Acidobacteria in the soil, and basidiomycetous fungi and Actinobacteriota in the litter. Compared with low fire frequencies, high fire frequency increased soil fungal plant pathogens, but reduced Actinobacteriota. The majority of fire effects on microbial communities were mediated by fire-induced changes in litter and soil abiotic properties. For instance, recent and more frequent fire was associated with reduced soil sulphur, which led to an increase in soil fungal plant pathogens and saprotrophic fungi in these sites. Pathogenic fungi also increased in recently burnt forests that had a low fire frequency, mediated by a decline in litter carbon and an increase in soil pH in these sites. Synthesis. Our findings indicate that predicted increases in the frequency of fire may select for specific microbial communities directly and indirectly through ecological interactions, which may have functional implications for plants (increase in pathogens, decrease in symbionts), decomposition rates (declines in Actinobacteriota and Acidobacteriota) and carbon storage (decrease in ectomycorrhizal fungi). In the face of predicted shifts in wildfire regimes, which may exacerbate fire-induced changes in microbial communities, adaptive fire management and monitoring is required to address the potential functional implications of fire-altered microbial communities.","YES",NA,"YES","YES","Article",NA,"NO",NA,"They don't have an UB control.

These deep sequence data (19000+ reads per sample after subsampling) indicate that frequent fires (3-year fire interval) shift soil fungus communities, whereas infrequent fires (6-year fire interval) permit system resetting to a state similar to that without prescribed fire. Furthermore, in nonmetric multidimensional scaling analyses, primarily ectomycorrhizal taxa were correlated with axes associated with long fire intervals, whereas soil saprobes tended to be correlated with the frequent fire recurrence.

This has led to reforestation efforts designed to increase American chestnut and white oak populations in this region, but success has been minimal. Since soil fungal communities are crucial to plant health, understanding how reforestation efforts alter soil fungal communities will inform reforestation efforts. Here, using nursery-reared bareroot seedlings of American chestnut, Chinese chestnut, 3rd generation backcross chestnut hybrids (BC3F3), and white oaks outplanted at a locally xeric site in the Southern Appalachian Mountains, we investigated if and how these species and backcross families within species differentially impact soil fungal communities. We demonstrate that after three years of growth, plant-associated soil fungal communities change similarly among different Fagaceae and are distinct from pre-planting soil communities. Interestingly, we observed differential shifts in fungal functional guilds among the Fagaceae species, although these were rather minimal. Taken together, the largely convergent shifts in soil communities across Fagaceae species suggest that these tree species may have similar impacts on soils and/or share similar communities that become enriched in closely related fungal species. The similarity in shared mutualist fungal communities suggests that companion planting or reforestation of genetically disease resistant American chestnut adjacent to establishing white oak trees might enhance survival and growth of both species at xeric sites.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"convergent shifts in soil fungal communities associated with fagaceae reforestation in the southern appalachian mountains"

We have isolated Rhizopogon species that were associated with the adult plants and used them to germinate seeds under gnotobiotic conditions. All Rhizopogon species isolated from either plant species were capable of stimulating seed germination in both Sarcodes and Pterospora. Under the primary conditions used, germination varied from 9 to 73%, in the case of Sarcodes and 0 to 13% in that of Pterospora. The single Rhizopogon strain that failed to elicit germination in Pterospora under these conditions did stimulate germination under slightly different conditions. By contrast, seeds failed to germinate on all media which lacked these Rhizopogon species, or in the presence of six other genera of basidiomycetes. Seed germination could be stimulated either through cellophane or at the edge of fungal colonies without direct fungus-seed contact. These results suggest that a diffusible or volatile compound that is unique to Rhizopogon stimulates germination of these plant seeds. Seed lots of Sarcodes from two successive years had similar germination levels. Sarcodes seeds that had overwintered under natural conditions were also stimulated to germinate. These results demonstrate the potential for long-term dormancy. We suggest that a combination of dormancy and the use of specific germination cues might increase the opportunities of these plants for recruitment. In addition, the specific germination response explains at least a part of the specialized associations observed in the adult plants.

Fire plays a major role in Mediterranean ecosystem dynamics and impacts both above- and below-ground community structure and functioning. However, studies on the effects induced by altered disturbance regimes (associated with recent land use and climate extremes) on fire ecology and especially on its below-ground impacts are few. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of different wildfire regimes on soil fungal community structure using two different molecular methods. We investigated the long-term effects of wildfire on soil fungal communities associated with Pinus pinaster forests in central Portugal, by comparing the results of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE)-based profiling with those obtained with 454 pyrosequencing. Four forest stands with differing fire history and fire return interval, and vegetation cover (mature forest, early successional stage of pine regeneration, and forest converted to scrubland) were sampled 6 years after the last fire event. The pyrosequencing-based approach indicated ca. eight-fold higher numbers of taxa than DGGE. However, fungal community fingerprinting data obtained for the different study stands with DGGE were congruent with those obtained with pyrosequencing. Both short (7.6 years) and long (24 years) fire return intervals (indicated by the presence of ericaceous shrubs in the understorey) induced a decrease in the abundance ratio between basidiomycetes and ascomycetes and appeared to reduce the frequency of ectomycorrhizal fungal species and saprophytes. Wildfire significantly reduced the frequency of late stage successional taxa (e.g. Atheliaceae and Cantharellales) and known or putative saprophytes belonging to the Clavulinaceae and the Archaeorhizomycetaceae. Conversely, early successional fungal species belonging to the Thelephoraceae were favoured by both fire return intervals, while the abundance of Cortinarius and Hebeloma, which include several Cistus-specific species, increased with short wildfire return intervals. This last finding highlights the relationship between post-fire vegetation composition and cover (vegetation successional stage), and fungal symbionts. We hypothesise that these changes could, in the long term, exhaust the resilience of Mediterranean pine forest vegetation and associated soil fungal communities by preventing pine regeneration.","YES",NA,"YES","YES","Article",NA,"YES",NA,"Although same daataset as in Buscardo (2012).

Soil samples were collected in four mountain sites with different fire return intervals and used to test ectomycorrhiza development in two hosts, Pinus pinaster and Quercus suber. RPCs were characterized by direct sequencing of fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions from individual ECM root tips. Eighteen ECM species were detected in the bioassay.

We analysed both publicly-available environmental DNA sequence data as well as soil chemistry data to test a hypothesis that burned areas in a contiguous tropical forest have different community composition and diversity of EM and saprotrophic soil fungi relative to nearby unburned sites. We tested this hypothesis by measuring community-level taxonomic composition, fungal diversity, species richness and evenness. We determined whether changes in fungal communities were associated with fire-altered soil chemical/physical properties, vegetation types, or the direct effect of fire. Soil fungi differed in abundance and community phylogenetic structure between forest sites that had experienced fire, and sites dominated by unburned forest. EM community composition differed between unburned and burned sites, which had more mycorrhizal hosts including Corymbia intermedia, Acacia flavescens and Acacia midgleyi.

To fill this gap, this study has evaluated the short-term (one year after wildfire) changes in ecosystem properties (associated to soil characteristics), structure (linked to plant diversity), individual ecosystem functions, and EMF in a Mediterranean forest. This delicate ecosystem was burned by a wildfire and then mulched with straw or wood chips, and EMF in these conditions was compared to burned and untreated, and unburned sites. The results have shown that: (i) neither wildfire nor mulching significantly changed soil properties with the exception of pH; (ii) in contrast, ecosystem structure significantly declined in mulched plots due to wildfire, and mulching did not limit the alteration in species richness; (iii) among the analysed ecosystem functions, waste decomposition and nutrient cycling, which were significantly higher in unburned soils compared to burned sites, showed intermediate and similar values in mulched plots, while water cycle and wood production (the latter with the exception of unburned plots) were similar among all soil conditions, and climate regulation was significantly higher only in soils mulched with wood chips compared to burned sites; (iv) EMF increased from burned and untreated soils to unburned sites; (v) mulching was effective at limiting the reduction in EMF due to wildfire, but only partially dampened the impact of the fire. Moreover, the combined analysis of ecosystem properties, structure and functions, and EMF revealed that: (i) all functions, except water cycle, were associated to one or more soil or vegetation parameters; (ii) species community composition noticeably influ-enced several ecosystem functions, and, therefore, EMF; (iii) species richness is a key driver of wood production; (iv) pH, which was found as the most influential soil property on ecosystem functions and EMF, may be considered as an important ecological predictor of forest functions in basic soils of Mediterranean forests.

We investigated how a surface wildfire that occurred after several decades of fire exclusion affected a southern Appalachian forest transitioning from a fire-adapted to a fire-intolerant state. Tree traits associated with fire adaptation often co-occur with traits for nutrient conservation, including the ectomycorrhizal (ECM) association. In the absence of fire, the ECM association may facilitate the accumulation of organic matter, which becomes colonized by fine roots that then become vulnerable to consumption or damage by fire. Therefore, a deeper organic horizon might make stands of fire-adapted, ECM trees less resistant to a surface wildfire than stands of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM), fire-intolerant trees. To test this hypothesis, we established plots in stands that fall along a gradient of mycorrhizal tree relative abundance both inside and outside the perimeter of the 2016 Rock Mountain wildfire. With increasing relative abundance of ECM trees, we found increasing organic horizon depth and mass and slower rates of decay, even for litter of ECM tree species. We calculated a major (73-83%) reduction in fine root biomass and length in the organic horizon following the wildfire. Over three years post-fire, we observed a higher probability of crown decline, basal sprouting and aboveground biomass mortality with increasing abundance of ECM trees. We propose that the biogeochemistry of mycorrhizal associations can help explain why fire exclusion makes stands of fire-adapted trees less resistant to a surface wildfire than those with fire-intolerant trees.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","YES","YES","Article",NA,"NO","Off_topic","The article does not approach fire effects on the fungal community","USA","benefit or liability the ectomycorrhizal association may undermine tree adaptations to fire after longterm fire exclusion"

But, knowledge of suitable plants is lacking and we know very little about the role symbiotic bacteria and fungi adapted to heavy metals play in phytoremediation. This paper reports the occurrence of plants, and their symbiotic associations with soil microbes, at heavy metal contaminated abandoned mine sites in New South Wales, Australia. Knowledge of suitable plants that might be used for phytoremediation of heavy metal contaminated soil is lacking. Furthermore, since metal uptake and tolerance depend on both plant and soil factors, we also require information on plant-soil interactions. The plants growing on contaminated soils are normally slow growing producing a small biomass but they accumulate heavy metals in their tissues lowering the quantity and controlling the migration of heavy metals through the soil profile. Symbiotic bacteria and fungi adapted to heavy metal can be utilized to enhance the growth of such plants. At the contaminated site species richness was poor.

These mostly endemic fungi are critical to postfire reestablishment of regenerating vegetation, and their fruit-bodies provide essential food resources for diverse ground-dwelling fauna. We developed habitat models for five common representatives of the mesophelliaceae based on repeat collections of their fruit-bodies from 136 study plots situated along a series of environmental gradients across the south-eastern mainland of Australia. At a meso- or landscape scale, temperature influenced the occurrence of Castoreum radicatum, Mesophellia clelandii and Nothocastoreum cretaceum, with the type of response varying. Below a threshold, C. radicatum preferred sites with cooler mean annual temperatures. In contrast, M. clelandii and N. cretaceum had optimal ranges of temperature, above and below which the probability of detecting them dropped. Also at a landscape scale, C. radicatum was more likely to be detected at sites with lower levels of precipitation during the driest quarter of the year. At a micro-site scale, M. clelandii and N. cretaceum were more likely to occur in stands with an intermediate number of host eucalypt stems, likely relating to successional age of the stand. Sites with a higher number of large fallen trees were more likely to have N. cretaceum, while sites with intermediate litter depths were more likely to have C. radicatum and M. clelandii. Mesophellia glauca and M. trabalis showed no consistent patterns. They are apparently the most broadly adaptable in terms of the independent variables tested. Although fire has been previously suggested to be heavily implicated in the life cycle of several members of the Mesophelliaceae, we found no relationship between time since disturbance by fire and other factors and likelihood of occurrence. Instead, other habitat attributes appeared to be more important in explaining their distribution. The complex and differing responses of the species of Mesophelliaceae studied here, to features of their environment, reinforce the need to manage multiple-use forest landscapes across the region for a diversity of attributes.

Faecal analysis confirmed the mycophagous habit of P. tridactylus at aa eucalypt forest site in East Gippsland, Victoria; in one month, the spores of 33 different fungi were identified. The majority of species (27) were hypogeal or subhypogeal gasteromycetes that form ectomycorrhizae with forest trees and shrubs, and included the widespread and common Mesophellia pachythrix. The possible role of mycophagy in establishment of eucalypt-fungal mycorrhizae was investigated in several ways. Fungal spores were viable after passage through the gut of P. tridactylus; application of spore-bearing faeces to seedlings of Eucalyptus sieberi and Eucalyptus globoidea grown in sterile soil produced ectomycorrhizae. Spores of M. pachythrix were among the most common spores in these faeces and some of the resulting ectomycorrhizae were of the type expected from M. pachythrix. In contrast, direct application of M. pachythrix spores from sporocarp tissue to seedlings produced no ectomycorrhizae. Ectomycorrhizae also were established on seedlings grown in unsterilized forest soil, indicating that soil-borne spores had been conditioned, either by passage through the gut of aa mammal or some other means, for reaction with the roots of eucalypts. Addition of faeces improved root and shoot growth of seedlings, although we could not determine whether this was primarily due to the formation of ectomycorrhizae, the addition of nutrients in the faeces, or aa combination of both. Potorous tridactylus may enhance the re-establishment of mycorrhizal colonies in logged and/or burned forest sites by dispersing in its faeces, the spores of mycorrhizal fungi from sporocarps consumed within the disturbed area, as well as spores from sporocarps eaten in adjacent undisturbed habitat.

However, despite the strong potential for interactions between them, few studies have examined how patterns of forest succession affect mycorrhizal associations that a majority of plant species depend on to alleviate soil resource constraints. Fire suppression in subalpine forests over the last century has changed successional patterns in ways that may have important implications for mycorrhizal associations of forest tree species. To better understand these relationships we conducted a field and greenhouse study in which we examined mycorrhizal infection along gradients of light intensity and soil nutrient availability that develop as aspen becomes seral to conifers under longer fire return intervals. We examined whether ectomycorrhizal associations of quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), a shade intolerant, early succession species, were more sensitive to light and soil resource limitations than subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), a shade tolerant, late succession species. In the field study, ectomycorrhizal infection of aspen roots was reduced by 50% in conifer dominated stands relative to aspen stands. In contrast, subalpine fir maintained its EM associations regardless of the successional status of the stand. The greenhouse results were consistent with field results and indicated that light limitation was the driving force behind reductions in EM infection of aspen roots in later stages of succession. These results suggest that nutrient limitations constraining early successional species may be exacerbated by losses in EM associations via light limitations created by late successional species. This is one potential mechanism by which climax forest species create a competitive advantage over early successional species and these results suggest that it is likely exacerbated by longer fire return intervals.

A better understanding of the dynamics and drivers of root-associated fungal communities is essential to predict long-term soil C storage and climate feedbacks in northern ecosystems. We used 454-pyrosequencing to identify fungal communities across fine-scaled soil profiles in a 5000yr fire-driven boreal forest chronosequence, with the aim of pinpointing shifts in fungal community composition that may underlie variation in below-ground C sequestration. In early successional-stage forests, higher abundance of cord-forming ectomycorrhizal fungi (such as Cortinarius and Suillus species) was linked to rapid turnover of mycelial biomass and necromass, efficient nitrogen (N) mobilization and low C sequestration. In late successional-stage forests, cord formers declined, while ericoid mycorrhizal ascomycetes continued to dominate, potentially facilitating long-term humus build-up through production of melanized hyphae that resist decomposition. Our results suggest that cord-forming ectomycorrhizal fungi and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi play opposing roles in below-ground C storage. We postulate that, by affecting turnover and decomposition of fungal tissues, mycorrhizal fungal identity and growth form are critical determinants of C and N sequestration in boreal forests.See also the Commentary by Christopher W.

In addition, it can form both ectomycorrhizas and arbuscular mycorrhizas. In this paper, we review the information available on the ectomycorrhizal fungi of Cistus across its entire geographic range, as gathered and critically sifted from both published literature sources and personal observations.

The combustion of fuels containing large downed wood can result in intense soil heating, alteration of soil properties, and mortality of microbes. Previous studies show ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) improve ponderosa seedling establishment after fire but did not compare EMF communities at different levels of soil burn intensity in a field setting. For this study, soil burn intensity effects on nutrients and EMF communities were compared at Pringle Falls Experimental Forest, La Pine, Oregon. Twelve replicate sites were used, each with three treatments: high intensity soil burn from large downed wood combustion (HB), low intensity soil burn (LB), and unburned control (UB). Temperatures lethal to fungi were detected at 0-cm, 5-cm, and 10-cm depths in HB soils and 0-cm depth in LB soils. Ponderosa pine seedlings planted post-burn were harvested after four months for EMF root tip analysis. We found: (a) greater differences in soil properties and nutrients in HB soils compared to LB and UB soils; (b) no differences in EMF richness and diversity among treatments; (c) weak differences in community composition based on relative abundance between UB and either burn treatments; and (d) EMF composition in HB and LB treatments correlated with soil carbon and organic matter contents. These results support the hypothesis that the combustion of large downed wood can alter the soil environment directly beneath it. However, an EMF community similar to LB soils recolonized HB soils within one growing season. Community results from both burn treatments suggest an increase in patchy spatial distribution of EMF. We hypothesize that quick initiation of EMF recolonization is possible depending on the size of high intensity burn patches, proximity of low and unburned soil, and survival of nearby hosts. The importance of incorporating mixed fire effects in fuel management practices will help to provide EMF refugia for ponderosa pine forest regeneration.

Over 200,000 nursery seedlings have been planted in the western U.S. but survival rates are low and in many areas approach zero. One possibility for enhancing seedling survival is application of mycorrhizal fungi in the greenhouse before out-planting. All pines require ectomycorrhizal fungi (ECM) to survive in nature, including whitebark pine. Non-mycorrhizal seedlings are at risk of dying when planted in soil lacking appropriate mycorrhizal fungi; this might include ghost forests, severe burns, dry habitats and areas not previously in pine. This study screened 25 isolates of native ECM fungi (primarily suilloids) from whitebark pine forests in the Greater Yellowstone Area as a preliminary step in development of an effective inoculum for whitebark pine seedlings grown in forest nurseries. Most are 'suilloid' fungi specific for 5-needle pines. A majority grew well in vitro and selected strains were then used to develop various types of mycorrhizal inoculum. Four basic inoculation methods were tested under greenhouse conditions using spore slurries and soil inocula. Spore slurries added to soil produced the highest rate of mycorrhizal colonization (100 per cent frequency) in the shortest time (3-5 months), but colonization also occurred with soil inoculum (mycelium). Fertilization was found to suppress mycorrhizal colonization at least at the high levels tested. Soil substrate was found to be an important factor in ECM colonization and some soil mixes suppressed or prevented colonization. Commercial inoculum is not recommended since it risks introduction of alien fungi, it may not favor 5-needle pines, and therefore has the potential to disturb sensitive whitebark pine systems.

Two controls were used; in unmodified control plots nothing was added to the soil, and in perlite plots perlite, a chemically neutral substance, was added to maintain soil moisture and temperature at levels similar to those under litter. We found that (i) species richness did not change significantly following perlite addition (2.6 +/- 0.3 species/core in control plots, compared with 2.3 +/- 0.3 species/core in perlite plots) but decreased significantly (P < 0.05) following litter addition (1.8 +/- 0.3 species/core); (ii) EM infection was not affected by the addition of perlite but increased significantly (P < 0.001) in response to litter addition, and the increase occurred only in the upper soil layer, directly adjacent to the added litter; and (iii) Suillus granulatus, Wilcoxina mikolae, and agaricoid DD were the dominant organisms in controls, but the levels of W. mikolde and agaricoid DD decreased significantly in response to both perlite and litter addition. The relative levels of S. granulatus and a fourth fungus, Cortinariaceae species 2, increased significantly (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively) following litter addition. Thus, litter addition resulted in some negative effects that may be attributable to moisture-temperature relationships rather than to the increased nutrients associated with litter. Some species respond positively to litter addition, indicating that there are differences in their physiologies.

However, recent studies show that few ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi appear to have evolved post-fire adaptations, no succession of EM fungi following fire is apparent after low intensity fires, and only two EM fungal taxa exclusively fruit at post-fire conditions. In this paper I review the present knowledge of effects of forest fire on EM fungal communities in Fennscandian boreal forests, put into perspective by a comparison from other parts of the world. Characteristically, these boreal forests consist of less than a handful of tree species, e.g. Scots pine and Norway spruce, while the below ground communities of EM fungi is impressively species rich with presently more than 700 known taxa. Commonly, forest fires in Fennoscandia have been of low intensity, with a considerable portion of the trees surviving and the organic humus layer partly escaping combustion. Hence, EM fungi appear to largely have evolved under conditions characterised by a more or less continuous presence of their hosts. In fact, the composition of EM fungi within a forest appear be more variable due to spatial variation than due to wildfire. However, in areas with high intensity bums and high tree mortality, most EM fungi may locally be killed. Thus, the legacy of EM fungi following wildfire depends on the survival of trees, which determine the potential for mycorrhizal growth, and the combustion and heating of the organic soil, which directly correlate to mortality of mycorrhizas. The questions if and to what degree fires may be of significance for yet unidentified spatiotemporal dynamics of EM fungal populations and communities are discussed. Recent experiments indicate a few EM fungi are favoured by high intensity burn conditions whereas others disappear. The consequences of wildfires in temperate conifer forests differ considerably from those in boreal forests. Wildfires in temperate conifer forests are typically high intensity stand-replacing fires that cause a total combustion of organic layers. Subsequently, pre-fire EM fungal communities are largely eradicated and a succession of post-fire EM fungi is initiated.","MAYBE","Review","MAYBE","YES","Review","DOWNLOADED",NA,NA,NA,NA,"effects of fire on ectomycorrhizal fungi in fennoscandian boreal forests"

We aim to assess the distribution of heat-resistant soil fungi across burned stands of boreal forest in the Northwest Territories, Canada, and understand their functions in relation to decomposition and tree seedling growth. We cultured and identified fungi from heat-treated soils and linked sequences from known taxa with high throughput sequencing fungal data (Illumina MiSeq, ITS1) from soils collected in 47 plots. We assessed functions under controlled conditions by inoculating litter and seedlings with heat-resistant fungi to assess decomposition and effects on seedling growth, respectively, for black spruce (Picea mariana), birch (Betula papyrifera), and jack pine (Pinus banksiana). We also measured litter decomposition rates and seedling densities in the field without inoculation. We isolated seven taxa of heat-resistant fungi and found their relative abundances were not associated with environmental or fire characteristics.

In the field, birch litter decomposed faster in stands with greater pre-fire proportion of black spruce, while black spruce litter decomposed faster in stands experiencing longer fire-free intervals. Densities of seedlings that had germinated since fire were positively associated with ectomycorrhizal richness while there were fewer conifer seedlings with greater heat-resistant fungal abundance.

Understanding relationships between fungal community composition, particularly mycorrhizas, and understory plant composition is therefore important in predicting how future fire regimes may affect vegetation. We used an extreme wildfire event in boreal forests of Canada's Northwest Territories to test drivers of fungal communities and assess relationships with plant communities. We sampled soils from 39 plots 1 year after fire and 8 unburned plots. High-throughput sequencing (MiSeq, ITS) revealed 2,034 fungal operational taxonomic units. We found soil pH and fire severity (proportion soil organic layer combusted), and interactions between these drivers were important for fungal community structure (composition, richness, diversity, functional groups). Where fire severity was low, samples with low pH had higher total fungal, mycorrhizal, and saprotroph richness compared to where severity was high. Increased fire severity caused declines in richness of total fungi, mycorrhizas, and saprotrophs, and declines in diversity of total fungi and mycorrhizas. The importance of stand age (a surrogate for fire return interval) for fungal composition suggests we could detect long-term successional patterns even after fire. Mycorrhizal and plant community composition, richness, and diversity were weakly but significantly correlated. These weak relationships and the distribution of fungi across plots suggest that the underlying driver of fungal community structure is pH, which is modified by fire severity. This study shows the importance of edaphic factors in determining fungal community structure at large scales, but suggests these patterns are mediated by interactions between fire and forest stand composition.","YES",NA,"YES","YES","Article",NA,"YES",NA,NA,"Canada","wildfire severity reduces richness and alters composition of soil fungal communities in boreal forests of western canada"

The aim of the study was to assess whether mycorrhizal propagules that survived fire episodes could serve as in situ inoculum sources, and to analyse the spatial distribution of soil nutrients and mycorrhizal parameters. In a laboratory bioassay, P. pinaster and Q. ilex seedlings were grown on soils from the target sites and root colonisation by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi was determined. The ECM root colonisation levels found indicated that soil from Site 2 contained sufficient ECM propagules to serve as a primary source of inoculum for P pinaster. The low levels of ECM and AM colonisation obtained on the roots of plants grown in soil from Site 1 indicated that the existing mycorrhizal propagules might be insufficient for effective root colonisation of Q. ilex.

Their resilience has been eroded as a result of climate change and anthropogenic impacts, making them vulnerable to increasingly frequent episodes of drought, fire and the spread of pests and diseases. The impact of these natural and anthropogenic events on soil biodiversity is of particular concern, as the soil fungal community plays a key role in ecosystem homeostasis.Objectives and methods: In order to analyse the relationship between soil health status and fungal diversity, soil samples were collected from declining Mediterranean forests of Castanea sativa (chestnut), Quercus ilex (holm oak), Quercus suber (cork oak) and Quercus pyrenaica (Pyrenean oak). A metabarcoding study was carried out by sequencing the ITS genomic region.Results: A total of 674 fungal genera were found. It has not been possible to explain the differences in health status from the fungal genera found exclusively on declining forest soils, as none of them have been described as pathogenic. Healthy chestnut soils were characterized by a high alpha diversity and a higher abundance of the genus Metarhizium. No differentially abundant genera were found in any of the other forest species tested. Declining chestnut soils harbored more abundance of ectomycorrhizae and soil saprotrophs than healthy samples. Ectomycorrhizae were the dominant lifestyle in all oak species regardless of health status, whereas arbuscular mycorrhizae were preferentially found in declining cork oak soils.Discussion: This work highlights the resilience of fungal communities of soil against decline and highlights the need to further investigate its relationship with the forest's ability to cope with the challenges of climate change.","YES","ECM community changes under CC not fire specifically","YES","YES","Article",NA,"NO","Off_topic","Did not approach directly wildfires as a cause of declining forests","Spain","rhizosphere mycobiome diversity in four declining mediterranean tree species"

We used molecular methods to compare belowground ECM species richness, composition, and abundance between adjacent stands of homogenous lodgepole pine (established after a fire around 1867) and old growth mixed conifer (around 300 years old) in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). In each stand type, we collected soil cores to both identify mycorrhizae and assess soil chemistry. Although no statistical difference was observed in the mean number of ECM root tips per core between stand types, the total number of species identified (81 versus 35) and the mean number of species per core (8.7 +/- 0.5 versus 2.5 +/- 0.3) were significantly higher in lodgepole pine. Species compositions were widely disparate between stands where only four of 112 species were shared. Soil analysis revealed that mixed conifer was significantly lower in mean pH, but higher in mean organic matter, potassium, phosphorus, and ammonium when compared to lodgepole pine. Although analysis of covariance did not statistically demonstrate that soil chemistry is driving ECM community structure with certainty, our data are, nonetheless, consistent with this hypothesis. Our data further suggest that fungal richness declines and composition shifts some time after Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir colonize mature lodgepole pine stands, and that time since last wildfire influences soil chemistry in this system. Moreover, because of data limitations, future field experiments will be necessary to determine if soil chemistry, as well as other biotic and abiotic factors not examined in this study, is a primary influence on ECM community structure at our study site in YNP.

However, overall trends for fungal response to fire, which can be especially critical in a post-fire context, have been difficult to elucidate. We used meta-analytical techniques to investigate fungal response to fire across studies, ecosystems, and fire types. Change in fungal species richness and mycorrhizal colonization were used as the effect size metrics in random effects models. When different types of methods for assessing fungal species richness and mycorrhizal colonization were considered together, there was an average reduction of 28 % in fungal species richness post fire, but no significant response in mycorrhizal colonization. In contrast, there was a 41 % reduction in fungal species richness post fire when assessed by sporocarp surveys, but fungal species richness was not significantly affected when assessed by molecular methods. Measured in situ, fire reduced mycorrhizal colonization by 21 %, yet no significant response occurred when assessed by ex situ bioassays. These findings suggest that the putative magnitude of fire effects on soil fungal communities may be dependent on the approach and assessment method used. Furthermore, biome, but not fire type (i.e., wildfire versus prescribed fire) was a significant moderator of our categorical models, suggesting that biome might be a more useful predictor of fungal species richness response to fire than fire type. Reductions in fungal species richness and in situ mycorrhizal colonization post fire declined logarithmically and approached zero (i.e., no effect) at 22 and 11 years, respectively. We concluded that fire reduces fungal species richness and in situ mycorrhizal colonization, but if conditions allow communities to recover (e.g., without subsequent disturbance, favorable growing conditions), soil fungi are resilient on decadal time scales; the resiliency of soil fungi likely contributes to the overall rapid ecosystem recovery following fire.","MAYBE","Meta-analysis","MAYBE","YES","Meta-analysis","DOWNLOADED",NA,NA,NA,NA,"fire reduces fungal species richness and <i>in situ<i> mycorrhizal colonization a metaanalysis"

Despite this, the spatial and temporal scales over which plants influence microbial communities is poorly understood, particularly whether past abiotic or biotic legacies strongly constrain microbial community development. We examined biogeochemical cycling and microbial community structure in a coastal landscape where historical patterns of vegetation transition after a large fire in 1995 are well known, allowing us to account for past abiotic and biotic conditions. We found that alternative states in microbial community structure and ecosystem processes emerged under different plant species, regardless of past conditions. Greenhouse studies further demonstrated that these differences arise from direct plant selection of microbes, with selection stronger in roots compared with soils, especially for bacteria. Correlation of microbial community structure with seedling growth rates was also stronger for fungi compared to bacteria. Despite these effects, minimal overlap between seedling and field microbial communities indicates that the effects of initial plant selection are not stable; rather, plant selection initiated alternative successional trajectories after the fire. Using data from a guild where we have abundant natural history information, ectomycorrhizal fungi, we show that greenhouse communities are dominated by ruderal taxa that are also common in the field after the fire and that these ruderal fungi strongly alter spatial patterns in plant-soil feedback, enabling invasion and transformation of soils previously occupied by heterospecific plants, thus potentially acting as keystone mutualists.","YES",NA,"YES","YES","Article",NA,"NO","Off_topic","Comparisons between different types of vegetation caused by a fire 20 years ago…","USA","plant selection initiates alternative successional trajectories in the soil microbial community after disturbance"

Mountain pine beetle has been documented as a natural disturbance agent that may precede wildfire in lodgepole pine forests (Pinus contorta var. latifolia). In this study, we characterize lodgepole pine regeneration and the related micro-site conditions across a range of disturbance scenarios associated with mountain pine beetle (MPB) infestation and wildfire; identify limitations for the germination, survival, recruitment and growth of natural and artificial regeneration in relation to the effects of site moisture, fire severity, and competition by vegetation; and provide guidance on how to manage beetle-infested lodgepole pine stands subsequently burned by wildfires. Germination, survival and recruitment of lodgepole pine seedlings over two growing seasons were compared on 18 disturbance plots with three fire severity classes, two moisture regimes, two seed provenances, and two seedbed types. In the growing seasons following the fire (2005 and 2006), seeded plots experienced bursts of spring germination followed by continuous minor waves of new germination that ended by August 2006. Wet sites experienced a higher level of natural regeneration, and the density of seedlings increased with decreasing fire severity. On dry sites, new germinants were rare due to the impact of high and moderate fire severity, and the highest germination rates existed where fire severity was lowest. Seed provenance did not influence germination and survival rates. In contrast to the germination, survival, and recruitment results, growth rates were highest on the dry sites and increased with increasing fire severity. Thus, although recruitment on dry sites is unlikely to sufficiently restock lodgepole pine stands, the survivors show the highest growth rates. Conversely, recruitment on wet sites was sufficient to restock these stands, but seedling growth rates will likely be impeded by competing vegetation. We found no evidence that the survival or growth of recruits on dry sites was affected by the adverse impacts of the beetle and burning on soil properties, and lower diversity of ectomycorrhizal communities and nitrogen-cycling communities.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"assessment of postbeetle impacts on natural regeneration of lodgepole pine"

Prescribed burning can mitigate the risk of wildfires by reducing the fuel load but prescribed burning may also alter the soil properties and reduce microbial and fungal activity, causing changes in the availability of nutrients deep in the soil layer. Although fungal communities are a vital part of post-fire restoration, some fire effects remain unclear. To examine the short-term effects of prescribed burning on soil fungal communities in Donana Biological Reserve (SW Spain), we collected soil samples pre-burn and 1 day, 6 and 12 months post-burn from burned plots to perform physicochemical and metabarcode DNA analyses.Results: Prescribed burning had no significant effect on the total fungal operational taxonomic unit richness and abundance. However, changes in soil pH, nitrogen and potassium content post-burn affected fungal community composition. Small non-significant changes in pH and phosphorous affected the composition of ectomycorrhizal fungi.Conclusions: The ectomycorrhizal fungal community appears to be resilient to the effects of low-to moderate-in-tensity fires and saprotrophic taxa may benefit from this kind of fire.

We found that the removal of ericaceous shrubs and associated ERI changed the composition of EMF communities, with larger effects occurring at earlier stages of the chronosequence. Removal of shrubs was associated with enhanced N availability, litter decomposition and enrichment of the recalcitrant OM fraction. We conclude that increasing abundance of slow-growing ericaceous shrubs and the associated fungi contributes to increasing nutrient limitation, impaired decomposition and progressive OM accumulation in boreal forests, particularly towards later successional stages.

Previous studies have not addressed the interacting effects of fire recurrence and severity on the ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) of maritime pine forests, although complex relationships between such fire regime attributes are expected. Here, we evaluated the medium-term effects of fire recurrence and severity on the EMF response of unmanaged, native pine ecosystems dominated by Pinus pinaster in the western Mediterranean Basin. We considered four key ecosystem functions computed from functional indicators (carbon regulation, decomposition, soil fertility, and plant production), which were pooled into an EMF construct. The fire regime effects on the trade-offs and synergies between the considered ecosystem functions were also analyzed.ResultsMultiple ecosystem functions responded differentially to fire recurrence and severity. Fire recurrence had a strong effect on soil fertility, decomposition, and plant production functions. No significant effects of fire severity on any of the individual functions were detected. However, both fire regime attributes interacted to determine soil fertility and decomposition functions, suggesting that their performance is only impaired by fire severity when fire recurrence is low. The differing responses to the fire regime attributes among ecosystem functions fostered a significant EMF response to fire severity and its interaction with fire recurrence, indicating that the effect of fire severity on EMF was stronger under low fire recurrence scenarios, even when relationships between individual functions and fire severity were weak. Fire recurrence caused significant trade-offs between functions to emerge. However, these trade-offs were not strong enough to differ significantly from the intrinsic trade-offs (i.e., regardless of the fire regime) of maritime pine ecosystems.ConclusionsOur results indicated the need to use an integrative approach to assess the response of ecosystem functioning to the fire regime in maritime pine ecosystems.

We specifically investigated the role played by fireinduced changes on above and belowground communities in the modulation of EMF responses at short-term after fire. For this purpose, we estimated EMF using an averaging approach from three ecosystem functions (carbon regulation, decomposition and soil fertility) and their standardized functional indicators in field plots burned at low and high fire severity 1-year after a wildfire occurred in a Mediterranean ecosystem in the central region of Spain. Plant taxonomic and functional richness, and the bacterial and fungal taxonomic richness, were measured in the plots as community properties with a potential intermediate control over fire severity effects on EMF. The ecological effects of fire severity on above and belowground communities were important in shaping EMF as evidenced by Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Indeed, the evidenced shrinkage exerted by high fire severity on EMF at short-term after fire was not direct, but modulated by fire-induced effects on the plant functional richness and the microbial taxonomic richness. However, EMF variation was more strongly modulated by indirect effects of fire severity on the biodiversity of soil microbial communities, than by the effects on the plant communities. Particularly, the fungal community exerted the strongest intermediate control (standardized SEM [3 coefficient = 0.62), which can be linked to the differential response of bacterial ([3 = -0.36) and fungal ([3 = -0.84) communities to fire severity evidenced here. Our findings demonstrate that the effects of fire severity on above and belowground communities are important drivers of shortterm ecosystem functioning.

Conifer mortality tends to be more common in high-elevation forests where stress from weather, insects, and disease result in higher rates of mortality and in the drier interior forests where mortality from fire, insects, and disease are common. Immediate mortality from fire damage may be obvious, but currently there is considerable controversy about labeling fire-injured green trees as dead that have a high probability of experiencing delayed mortality. Trees die when carbohydrates used in respiration exceed those produced in photosynthesis or water movement is impaired, the tree desiccates, and photosynthesis ceases. Immediate or delayed tree mortality may be directly due to biotic or abiotic causes and may be affected by previous damage, current condition (vigor), and attack by secondary agents such as bark beetles. A particular pathogen or insect usually attacks, damages, or kills only one portion of a tree. Trees that are damaged or attacked by pests and expected to have a dead or nonfunctional root system or a nonfunctional stem within 5 years may be considered either dead or death is imminent. Numerous studies have produced logistic regression equations or other statistical models to help determine probability of tree survival. We define and propose that a ""dead tree"" designation is justified for most species when at least three of the four quadrants from around the base of the root collar has cambium, inner bark, or phloem that are discolored and dead.

Around half of digging mammal species are now extinct or under conservation threat, and the majority of extant species have undergone marked range contractions. Our aim is to identify the role of digging mammals in ecosystem processes throughout Australia. We highlight how the actions of digging mammals are vital for maintaining ecosystem functioning and how their extirpation has led to loss of ecosystem functions. A review of the literature indicates that many aspects of the influence of bioturbation on ecosystem functioning have been studied. The role of digging mammals in arid and semi-arid zones has been previously established. We collate and review a broader scope of studies, including those carried out in the mesic woodlands and forests of Australia. We identify roles of digging mammals in the context of ecosystem functioning and conservation management. Bioturbation significantly alters soil processes, increasing soil turnover and altering the chemical and structural properties of soil. Greater water infiltration and decreased surface run-off and erosion alter soil hydrophobicity and increase soil moisture. Diggings capture organic matter, provide habitat for a diversity of microscopic and macroscopic organisms, and increase nutrient cycling. Mycophagous mammals disperse fungi (e.g. mycorrhizae), while all diggings can create suitable sites for fungal growth. Diggings also capture plant seeds, increasing seedling germination, recruitment and plant growth. The overall effect of mammal diggings is therefore increased plant vigour and resilience, increased biodiversity and consequently improved ecosystem functioning. We propose that the loss of digging mammals has contributed to the deterioration of ecosystems in Australia. Recognising the roles of digging mammals will inform potential management options such as species translocations or reintroductions.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"is the loss of australian digging mammals contributing to a deterioration in ecosystem function"

These changes have implications for the provisioning of microbially-mediated ecosystem services (e.g., carbon sequestration, clean water supplies) typically associated with forested watersheds. Challenges in sampling wildfire-impacted areas immediately post-burn have limited our assessment of short-term (i.e., days to weeks) changes in the soil microbiome and understanding of how microbial populations may influence post-fire biogeochemistry and ecosystem recovery. The identification of potential high severity wildfire proxies may help address some of these knowledge gaps. One potential proxy is pile burns scars, which are produced from a set of common techniques for fuel disposal and site preparation in conifer forests throughout the western US and beyond. We sampled depth-resolved layers from fire-impacted soil and combusted litter and woody materials in a series of recent pile burn scars near West Yellowstone, Montana and nearby unburned mineral soil controls to assess whether the pile burn scars exhibited microbial signatures characteristic of forest soils impacted by recent high severity wildfire. Changes in soil carbon and nitrogen chemistry and patterns of microbial alpha and beta diversity broadly aligned with those observed following wildfire, particularly the enrichment of so-called 'pyrophilous' taxa. Furthermore, many of the taxa enriched in burned soils likely encoded putative traits that benefit microorganisms colonizing these environments, such as the potential for fast growth or utilization of pyrogenic carbon substrates. We suggest that pile burn scars may represent a useful proxy along the experimental gradient from muffle furnace or pyrocosm studies to largescale prescribed burns in the field to advance understanding of the soil (and related layers, like ash) microbiome following high severity wildfires, particularly when coupled with experimental manipulation.

This synthesis addresses this knowledge gap and ranges from fire adaptations of specific fungi to succession and assembly fungal communities as they respond to spatially heterogenous burning within the landscape.

A pot experiment was used to study the persistence of T. melanosporum in firebreak soils in the short term, as a first step to assess the viability of these plantations. The influence of seedlings, soil heating, and liming was also tested. During the 2 y after plantation, T. melanosporum mycorrhizas increased their number, showing its ability to proliferate.

Soil compaction, the major disturbance associated with logging operations, could seriously hamper the resilience of soil microorganisms after the perturbation produced by fire. The main objective of this work was to assess the impact of post-fire salvage logging on the composition and structure of soil bacterial and fungi communities, as well as to correlate these findings with the changes in soil physicochemical properties. The management severely affected the soil physicochemical and microbial properties. Whereas an increase of alpha diversity was detected in the treated soils for the microbial community, the microbial functionality registered was lower when compared to control soils. Salvage logging profoundly altered the structure and composition of the microbial communities, being modifications in soil structure the main driver in the microbial community shifts. Soil degradation induced by logging operations resulted in new niches related to anoxic habitats, being Proteobacteria and Firmicutes families, capable of anaerobic respiration, families with high abundance in the affected soils. In addition, the depletion in C and N nutrients as a consequence of the soil erosion reduced the microbial populations sensitive to substrates availability, e.g. Actinomycetales. Ascomycota increased proportionally in managed soils, which might be due to the removal of host plants dependent on ectomycorrhizal fungi.

Bulk soil and soil from beneath host plants were gathered in July 2004 and assayed for five enzymes that target organic C, P, and N substrates.

In transects of approximately 400 m total length, 167 macrofungal species were recorded in the unharvested aggregates compared to 125 species in the regenerating harvested area, with 63 species common to both. The regenerating area was a source of many saprotrophic fungi and also contained many species that are characteristically opportunistic, appearing after disturbance or fire but not generally seen in forests that have progressed beyond the earliest stage of regeneration. The regenerating area also contained a few species normally associated with mature forest, the presence of which may be attributed to the proximity of mature forest retained in the aggregates. Comparison of the aggregates with an unharvested control coupe sampled at the same intensity and over the same time period indicated lower species richness in the aggregates. This suggests that there are factors present, such as effects of the initial site preparation, opening up of the canopy, and proximity of the surrounding harvested areas, which tend to suppress the full development of the mycota in the aggregates. Nevertheless, the majority of ectomycorrhizal species in the aggregated retention coupe were found only in the unharvested aggregates, indicating that the latter are important reservoirs of ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity, and that they may be expected to show an increased species richness at a later stage of regeneration of the surrounding forest.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"aggregated retention and macrofungi a case study from the warra lter site tasmania"

Forested ecosystems undergo natural disturbances of fire and windthrow and disturbances involved in management (thinning, harvesting, control burning). Using the New Jersey pine barrens as model system for eastern US mixed forests, we have observed that under conditions of repeated physical soil disruption or,control burning, the pine barrens forest understory can change from ericaceous to graminoid species dominance through suppression of the ericaceous plants. In order to predict changes in soil properties and assess the potential to maintain this alternate herbaceous layer community, replicate manipulation plots were established the Franklin Parker Preserve in the New Jersey pine barrens. The manipulations consisted of: intact forest controls (CONT), canopy tree thinning (THIN) and canopy tree thinning plus ercicaceous stem removal and soil tilling (THIN & PLOW). The manipulations were designed to increase sunlight penetration to the forest floor and to encourage graminoid plant species establishment. Soil active carbon, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), six hydrolytic enzyme activities and two oxidative enzyme activities under three different treatments were measured. In the 0-10 cm soil depth, we observed that protease and arylsulfatase activity showed a significant decrease in the THIN and THIN & PLOW treatments compared to CONT, the activities of cellulase and phenol oxidase were significantly lower in THIN than CONT and THIN & PLOW, whereas the trend of peroxidase activity was opposite. There were no significant differences between treatments for glucosaminase, glucosidase and acid phosphatase activities. For the 10-20 cm soil depth only acid phosphatase and phenol oxidase activity significantly differed between treatments. We found that all enzyme activities except for peroxidase were significantly lower in the 10-20 cm soil horizon than in the 0-10 cm; peroxidase activity was significantly higher in the lower soil horizon. We demonstrated the activities of cellulase, phenoloxidase, arylsulfatase and protease were significantly and positively related to active C, but peroxidase activity was negatively correlated. Less expected is that only phenol oxidase was related to soil MBC, whereas the correlations between peroxidase, phenol oxidase, arysulfatase, protease activities and soil MBN were obvious. By understanding the relationships between microbial activity (enzyme production) and disturbance, we can determine the beneficial effects of many management practices on the potential nutrient availability for subsequent tree growth, since these enzymes are key to nutrient mineralization and carbon dynamics in soil.

We found that ECM spore bank fungi survived the fire and dominated the colonization of in situ and bioassay seedlings, but there were specific fire adapted fungi such as Rhizopogon olivaceotinctus that increased in abundance after the fire. The frequency of ECM fungal species colonizing pre-fire bioassay seedlings, post-fire bioassay seedlings and in situ seedlings were strongly positively correlated. However, fire reduced the ECM spore bank richness by eliminating some of the rare species, and the density of the spore bank was reduced as evidenced by a larger number of soil samples that yielded uncolonized seedlings. Our results show that although there is a reduction in ECM inoculum, the ECM spore bank community largely remains intact, even after a high-intensity fire. We used advanced techniques for data quality control with Illumina and found consistent results among varying methods.

We collected soil samples and vegetation measurements from sites across a gradient in time-since-fire ages (0-75 years-since-fire) and fire frequency (burnt 0-5 times during the recent 29-year period) in a semiarid heathland of south-eastern Australia. We characterized fungal communities using ITS amplicon-sequencing and assigned fungi taxonomically to trophic guilds. We used structural equation models to examine direct, indirect and total effects of time-since-fire and fire frequency on total fungal, ectomycorrhizal, saprotrophic and pathogenic richness. We used multivariate analyses to investigate how total fungal, ectomycorrhizal, saprotrophic and pathogenic species composition differed between post-fire successional stages and fire frequency classes. Time-since-fire was an important driver of saprotrophic richness; directly, saprotrophic richness increased with time-since-fire, and indirectly, saprotrophic richness declined with time-since-fire (resulting in a positive total effect), mediated through the impact of fire on substrates. Frequently burnt sites had lower numbers of saprotrophic and pathogenic species. Post-fire successional stages and fire frequency classes were characterized by distinct fungal communities, with large differences in ectomycorrhizal species composition. Understanding the complex responses of fungal communities to fire can be improved by exploring how the effects of fire flow through ecosystems.

Jarrah has an extensive surface (0-20 cm) system of fine lateral roots with ectomycorrhizal associations, while B. grandis produces a mat of cluster (proteoid) roots (0-20 cm) in the late winter and early spring. We measured seasonal changes in acid phosphatase activity and concentrations of ergosterol, microbial P and other P fractions (NaOH-extractable inorganic and organic P, Bray inorganic P) in soil from a forest where B. grandis was either present (Jarrah + Banksia) or absent (Jarrah). Acid phosphatase activity was between 30 and 40 mu mol p-NP g(-1) h(-1) in the moist winter and spring, but declined to less than 10 mu mol p-NP g(-1) h(-1) during the dry summer. Microbial P varied from less than 10 mug g(-1) in the late summer to more than 50 mug g(-1) during the wetter times of the year. Ergosterol also increased about four-fold as soil moisture content increased (P less than or equal to 0.05). Acid phosphatase was significantly and positively related to both ergosterol and microbial P in both Jarrah + Banksia and Jarrah soils, but the intercepts and slopes of the regressions varied seasonally and were not significantly different (P less than or equal to 0.05) between species composition. About 50% of the variation in phosphatase activity in Jarrah soils was explained by variation in fungal biomass (ergosterol), regardless of season, while in Jarrah + Banksia soils, 74% was explained by fungal biomass when soils were dry, decreasing to less than 10% as soil moisture increased. Linear regression models showed that ergosterol and microbial P are good predictors of acid phosphatase activity in soil, but their relative importance is dependent on plant species composition and season. We propose that the relative importance of fungal biomass as a determinant of phosphatase activity in the soil decreases as the seasonal flush of cluster roots dominate in the Jarrah + Banksia soils, while in Jarrah soils the phosphatase flush is primarily due to increased activity of the fungal biomass. Seasonal and spatial heterogeneity in microbial P, ergosterol and in the source of acid phosphatase in the soil are therefore a consequence of plant species composition and root type and will influence nutrient availability at the ecosystem scale.

The below-ground community composition of EM at the site was characterized using molecular techniques (PCR-RFLP and nucleotide sequencing).2 A total of 30 fungal taxa were observed, many of which differed in their distribution between treatment and control seedlings. However, most of the taxa that were distinctive to either treatment or control seedlings occurred only once across the site, precluding statistical detection of potential ash effects on EM community composition. There were no significant effects of ash removal on plot-level mycorrhizal community richness or diversity, and there were no distinct treatment-related clusters in a principal components analysis.3 Analysis of the combined data indicated that numbers of fungal taxa per seedling, numbers of successive root depth increments colonized by the same taxon, and distances to neighbouring seedlings colonized by the same taxon, were randomly distributed across the site for the majority of mycorrhizal fungi. These distributional patterns suggest that the post-fire mycorrhizal community structure on P. muricata arose primarily from successful colonization by randomly distributed point-source fungal inocula within the upper mineral soil layer of the forest floor.4 By comparison with pre-fire studies from similar P. muricata sites nearby, our data indicate that severe wildfire disturbance resulted in marked changes in mycorrhizal community composition, and a sharp increase in the relative biomass of ascomycetous fungi.","YES",NA,"YES","YES","Article",NA,"NO","Off_topic","NO UB control (control in this study means not removal of ash)","USA","belowground ectomycorrhizal community structure in a recently burned bishop pine forest"

While these disturbances can cause soil carbon (C) losses, the long-term accumulation dynamics of soil C stocks during subsequent stand development is controlled by biological processes related to the balance of net primary production (NPP) and outputs via heterotrophic respiration and leaching, many of which remain poorly understood. We review the biological processes suggested to influence soil C accumulation in boreal forests. Our review indicates that median C accumulation rates following wildfire and clear-cutting are similar (0.15 and 0.20 Mg ha(-1) year(-1), respectively), however, variation between studies is extremely high. Further, while many individual studies show linear increases in soil C stocks through time after disturbance, there are indications that C stock recovery is fastest early to mid-succession (e.g. 15-80 years) and then slows as forests mature (e.g. >100 years). We indicate that the rapid build-up of soil C in younger stands appears not only driven by higher plant production, but also by a high rate of mycorrhizal hyphal production, and mycorrhizal suppression of saprotrophs. As stands mature, the balance between reductions in plant and mycorrhizal production, increasing plant litter recalcitrance, and ectomycorrhizal decomposers and saprotrophs have been highlighted as key controls on soil C accumulation rates. While some of these controls appear well understood (e.g. temporal patterns in NPP, changes in aboveground litter quality), many others remain research frontiers. Notably, very little data exists describing and comparing successional patterns of root production, mycorrhizal functional traits, mycorrhizal-saprotroph interactions, or C outputs via heterotrophic respiration and dissolved organic C following different disturbances. We argue that these less frequently described controls require attention, as they will be key not only for understanding ecosystem C balances, but also for representing these dynamics more accurately in soil organic C and Earth system models.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"the biological controls of soil carbon accumulation following wildfire and harvest in boreal forests a review"

Fungi play critical roles in ecosystem processes such as decomposition and nutrient cycling, but have also been highlighted as significant contributors to organic matter build-up in boreal forest soils. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) mycelial biomass and necromass dynamics have recently been highlighted as essential for regulating build-up of soil organic matter. Understanding the extent to which shifts in mycelial community or growth trait composition cause changes in mycelial production and turnover over ecological gradients would aid a mechanistic understanding of these important processes at an ecosystem scale.2. Here, we test the hypotheses that shifting species and mycelial trait (exploration type) composition within the mycelial community underpin changes in biomass turnover with increasing forest age. We quantified mycelial turnover and assessed fungal community composition in a chronosequence of eight, 12- to 158-year-old, managed Pinus sylvestris forests. Turnover was estimated by determining mycelial biomass (ergosterol) in a sequence of ingrowth mesh bags and applying mathematical models. Fungal communities in the bags were identified using Pacific Biosciences sequencing of fungal ITS2 amplicons. To evaluate the accuracy of this method to represent all ECM fungi, community composition in bags was followed over time and compared with communities in soil.3. Mycelial communities changed with stand age, but we found no evidence that there were concurrent shifts in mycelial exploration types. Forest age and turnover were significantly correlated with ECM mycelial community composition and collectively explained 39.4% of total variation. The similarity between fungal communities in mesh bags and in soil was strongly forest age dependent, with communities in mesh bags diverging from soil communities in stands older than 60 years. However, in all stands, when bag incubation time exceeded 75 days, communities became more similar to soil communities.4. Synthesis. Our results support the idea that shifts in fungal community composition underpin the forest age-related decrease in mycelial turnover; however, since ingrowth mesh bags exclude some mycorrhizal species in older forests, it remains a possibility that turnover estimates were not reflecting the entire community. While we found no evidence that mycelial exploration types of fungi changed systematically with forest age, we suggest that other traits that relate to biomass turnover and necromass degradation require further study, as they may explain the extent to which ectomycorrhizal fungi regulate and contribute to soil organic matter accumulation.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"fungal community shifts underpin declining mycelial production and turnover across a <i>pinus sylvestris<i> chronosequence"

Study sites were located in the Blue Mountains of northeastern Oregon where prescribed fire treatments implemented in 1998 and thinning treatments in 2000 included prescribed fire, mechanical thinning of forested areas, a combination of thinning followed by fire, and an untreated control. Soil sampling for this study occurred in 2014 and included four replications of each treatment for a total of 16 experimental units. Differences among treatments in Bray-P, total C and N, and pH were likely driven by the thinning treatments and the resultant deposition of residual slash following harvesting or the consumption of slash by prescribed fire. Similar litter depths across treatments suggest that litter depth stabilizes over time in these forests. After more than a decade of recovery, mycorrhizal fungi in dry inland forests dominated by ponderosa pine that were subjected to fire returned to levels similar to the untreated controls.

In this study, we analyzed ECM fungal communities in tropical secondary forests dominated by Tristaniopsis and investigated which ECM fungal species are shared with other tropical or temperate areas. In total, 100 samples were collected from four secondary forests dominated by Tristaniopsis on Bangka Island. ECM tips in the soil samples were subjected to molecular analyses to identify both ECM and host species. Based on a > 97% ITS sequence similarity threshold, we identified 56 ECM fungal species dominated by Thelephoraceae, Russulaceae, and Clavulinaceae. Some of the ECM fungal species were shared between dominant Tristaniopsis and coexisting Eucalyptus or Quercus trees, including 5 common to ECM fungi recorded in a primary mixed dipterocarp forest at Lambir Hill, Malaysia. In contrast, no ECM fungal species were shared with other geographical regions, even with Tristaniopsis in New Caledonia. These results imply that secondary tropical forests dominated by Tristaniopsis harbor diverse ECM fungi, including those that inhabit primary dipterocarp forests in the same geographical region. They may function as refugia for ECM fungi, given that dipterocarp forests are disappearing quickly due to human activity.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ectomycorrhizal fungal communities of secondary tropical forests dominated by <i>tristaniopsis<i> in bangka island indonesia"

Sporocarps were collected and identified on a weekly basis during the autumn season from 2003 to 2006 in 100 m(2) plots located in recently burned plots (early stage) and mature stands (late stage). 146 fungal taxa were found during the 4-year sampling (56 late stage only and 23 early stage only). There was a shift in the taxa composition of fungal community during C ladanifer succession. Several taxa such as Coprinus spp. and Pholiota car-bonaria were found in the early stage of the succession, whereas late stage taxa like Lepista spp. or Con-ocybe spp. fruited in the last years of succession. Cistus-specific taxa such as Entoloma cistophilum, Hebeloma cistophilum and Lactarius cistophilus were classified as multi-stage taxa as they were able to fruit in both early and late stages. Furthermore, several mycorrhizal taxa, usually associated with mature forest tree stands, were able to fruit much earlier in C. ladanifer scrublands.

Sporocarp sampling was carried out on a weekly basis during autumnal production periods between 2010 and 2013. Twenty-seven plots (100 m(2)) were established in scrublands of different age and origin: (a) a middle-age scrubland (8 years old) whose origin was a forest fire, (b) a middle-age scrubland (8 years old) whose origin was the total clearing of the previous stand, and (c) a senescent scrubland (20 years old). Considered fuel reduction treatments were total clearing, 50% clearing and controlled burning. All the sporocarps were identified and fresh and dry weighed. A total of 63,436 sporocarps belonging to 157 taxa within 64 genera were collected during the four years' sampling.

We used molecular tools, including ARISA and fungal ITS sequencing, to characterize the mycorrhizal communities on resprouting Betula nana shrubs across a fire-severity gradient after the largest tundra fire recorded in the Alaskan Arctic (July-October 2007). Fire effects on the components of fungal composition were dependant on the scale of taxonomic resolution. Variation in fungal community composition was correlated with fire severity. Fungal richness and relative abundance of dominant taxa declined with increased fire severity. Yet, in contrast to temperate and boreal regions with frequent wildfires, mycorrhizal fungi on resprouting shrubs in tundra were not strongly differentiated into fire-specialists and fire-sensitive fungi. Instead, dominant fungi, including taxa characteristic of late successional stages, were present regardless of fire severity. It is likely that the resprouting life history strategy of tundra shrubs confers resilience of dominant mycorrhizal fungi to fire disturbance by maintaining an inoculum source on the landscape after fire.

To determine the role of root-associated fungi (RAF) in post-fire seedling recruitment and future biome shifts, we outplanted four dominant boreal tree and shrub species inoculated with one of three treatments at treeline and in tundra: burned boreal forest, unburned boreal forest, or a control treatment of sterilized inoculum. We compared survivorship, growth, and physiological performance of the seedlings in relation to mycorrhizal inoculum treatment and among host species, characterized the RAF communities based on ITS-rDNA sequencing of individual root tips sampled from surviving seedlings, and tested for correlations between RAF composition and the inoculation treatments, host species, and duration of the experiment. We explored correlations between RAF composition and seedling metrics. Both live and sterile autoclaved inoculation treatments had similar effects on seedling survivorship and growth for all species.

However, seedling traits and growth were correlated with RAF species composition, colonization, and the relative abundance of specific RAF taxa.Piceasp. performance in particular showed strong co-variation with RAF metrics. Our results suggest that mycorrhizal co-migration is not a primary limiting factor to boreal seedling recruitment because the experimental provision of inoculum did not affect seedling recruitment; yet, RAF did influence seedling performance, particularly resident RAF at treeline and in tundra, suggesting that mycorrhizal fungi are important to vegetation processes at the treeline-tundra ecotone.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"limited overall impacts of ectomycorrhizal inoculation on recruitment of boreal trees into arctic tundra following wildfire belie speciesspecific responses"

We investigated whether ectomycorrhizal shrubs that resprout after fire support similar fungal taxa to those that associate with tree seedlings that establish naturally after fire. We then assessed whether mycobiont identity correlates with the biomass or nutrient status of these tree seedlings. The majority of fungal taxa observed on shrub and seedling root systems were EMF, with some dark septate endophytes and ericoid mycorrhizal taxa. Seedlings and adjacent shrubs associated with similar arrays of fungal taxa, and there were strong correlations between the structure of seedling and shrub fungal communities.

We found that wildfires altered the composition of soil fungal communities. The relative abundance of ascomycetes significantly increased following fire whereas basidiomycetes decreased. Post-fire decreases in basidiomycete fungi were likely attributable to declines in ectomycorrhizal fungi. Fungal hyphal lengths in the organic horizon significantly declined in response to wildfire, and they required at least 24 years to return to pre-fire levels. Post-fire reductions in fungal hyphal length were associated with decreased activities of hydrolytic extracellular enzymes. In support of our hypothesis, the decomposition rate of aspen and black spruce litter significantly increased as forests recovered from fire. Our results indicate that post-fire reductions in soil fungal abundance and activity likely inhibit litter decomposition following boreal wildfires. Slower rates of litter decay may lead to decreased heterotrophic respiration from soil following fires and contribute to a negative feedback to climate warming.","YES",NA,"YES","YES","Article",NA,"YES",NA,NA,"USA","changes in soil fungal communities extracellular enzyme activities and litter decomposition across a fire chronosequence in alaskan boreal forests"

We investigated rhizosphere microbial communities in a resprouting Eucalyptus marginata forest, southwestern Australia, that had experienced a severe wildfire four years previously, and a hotter drought eight years previously. Our aim was to understand how microbial communities are affected over longer -term trajectories by hotter drought and wildfire, singularly, and in combination. Fungal and bacterial DNA was extracted from soil samples, amplified, and subjected to high throughput sequencing. Richness, diversity, composition, and putative functional groups were then examined. We found a monotonic decrease in fungal, but not bacterial, richness and diversity with increasing disturbance with the greatest changes resulting from the combination of drought and wildfire. Overall fungal and bacterial community composition reflected a stronger effect of fire than drought, but the combination of both produced the greatest number of indicator taxa for fungi, and a significant negative effect on the abundance of several fungal functional groups. Key mycorrhizal fungi, fungal saprotrophs and fungal pathogens were found at lower proportions in sites affected by drought plus wildfire. Wildfire had a positive effect on bacterial hydrogen and bacterial nitrogen recyclers. Fungal community composition was positively correlated with live tree height.

Testing whether microbes in different ecosystems will respond similarly to increased fire disturbance is difficult though, because fires are often unpredictable and hard to manage. Fire recurrent or pyrophilic ecosystems, however, may be useful models for testing the effects of frequent disturbance on microbes. We hypothesized that across pyrophilic ecosystems, fire would drive similar alterations to fungal communities, including altering seasonal community dynamics. We tested fire's effects on fungal communities in two pyrophilic ecosystems, a longleaf pine savanna and tallgrass prairie. Fire caused similar fungal community shifts, including (i) driving immediate changes that favored taxa able to survive fire and take advantage of post-fire environments and (ii) altering seasonal trajectories due to fire-associated changes to soil nutrient availability. This suggests that fire has predictable effects on fungal community structure and intra-annual community dynamics in pyrophilic ecosystems, and that these changes could significantly alter fungal function.

Forest decline has also been linked to alterations in ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungal communities, which are imperative for nutrient transfer and affect ecosystem productivity and health. Our aim was to determine the influence of soil chemistry on ECM fungal communities and tree health in declining temperate eucalypt forests. We hypothesise that forests with changed soil chemistry, in particular altered nitrogen cycling associated with forest decline, supports unique ECM fungal communities. ECM communities from twelve Eucalyptus delegatensis forest plots were characterised by DNA sequencing of root tip and sporocarp samples. Tree health and nutrient concentrations from soil and foliage samples were quantified for each plot. Multivariate and regression analyses and t-tests were used to determine ECM fungal community differences between forest health classes, and identify which soil variables were important for defining these communities. Elevated available soil nitrogen and soil acidity were associated with severely declining forest. Soil pH, nitrate and organic carbon significantly explained the majority of variation in ECM fungal community composition and structure, which differed between moderately and severely declining forest. Russulaceae species richness was greatest in acidic soils (severely declining forest) while Cortinariaceae species richness was greatest in soils with lower concentrations of soil nitrate (moderately declining forest). Total ECM fungal richness was inversely related to available soil phosphorus and soil nitrate. Thus, altered soil chemistry associated with eucalypt forest decline mediates changes in the ECM fungal community.

Samples were taken at the beginning of the growing season (June) and at the end of the growing season (September) after fire disturbance. ECM fungi were identified by high-throughput sequencing method to explore the changes and key influencing factors of ECM fungal community under the treatment of fire and black carbon addition.Important findings The results showed that: (1) During the growing season, compared with CK, the alpha-diversity of ECM fungal community treated by fire decreased significantly by 31.52%, while it increased significantly by 49.02% under black carbon addition treatment. There were significant differences in the beta-diversity of of ECM fungal community under fire and black carbon addition treatments during the growing season. (2) During the growing season, the abundance of ECM fungi treated by fire decreased significantly by 46.35%, but the fire treatment significantly increased Basidiomycetes species abundance, while black carbon addition treatment increased Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes species abundance. (3) During the growing season, the composition of ECM fungal community in Larix gmelini forest was significantly affected by soil pH, water content and total nitrogen content under the fire and black carbon addition treatments, but it was positively correlated with soil pH and total nitrogen content and negatively correlated with soil water content in the black carbon addition treatment. The results of this study showed that fire reduced the diversity of ECM fungi in Larix gmelinii forest during the growing season, and significantly reduced the abundance of ECM fungi. However, the addition of black carbon after fire may change this negative effect. By affecting the changes of soil pH and soil nitrogen content, black carbon promoted the recovery of ECM fungi and increased its diversity.

A considerable amount of literature has been published on how wildfires affect boreal forest regeneration. However, we lack understanding about how soil-mediated effects of fire disturbance on seedlings occur via soil abiotic properties versus soil biota. We collected soil from stands with three different severities of burning (high, low and unburned) and conducted two greenhouse experiments to explore how seedlings of tree species (Betula pendula, Pinus sylvestris and Picea abies) performed in live soils and in sterilized soil inoculated by live soil from each of the three burning severities. Seedlings grown in live soil grew best in unburned soil. When sterilized soils were reinoculated with live soil, seedlings of P. abies and P. sylvestris grew better in soil from low burn severity stands than soil from either high severity or unburned stands, demonstrating that fire disturbance may favor post-fire regeneration of conifers in part due to the presence of soil biota that persists when fire severity is low or recovers quickly post-fire. Betula pendula did not respond to soil biota and was instead driven by changes in abiotic soil properties following fire. Our study provides strong evidence that high fire severity creates soil conditions that are adverse for seedling regeneration, but that low burn severity promotes soil biota that stimulates growth and potential regeneration of conifers. It also shows that species-specific responses to abiotic and biotic soil characteristics are altered by variation in fire severity. This has important implications for tree regeneration because it points to the role of plant-soil-microbial feedbacks in promoting successful establishment, and potentially successional trajectories and species dominance in boreal forests in the future as fire regimes become increasingly severe through climate change.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","YES","YES","Article",NA,"NO","Off_topic","Did not approach ECM community parameters","Sweden","effects of soil abiotic and biotic factors on tree seedling regeneration following a boreal forest wildfire"

Our objective was to study the fungal community and the effects of an experimental forest management program, which combines harvesting and implantation, on the soil fungal communities in Patagonian woodland, in Argentina; considering contrasting seasons and soil parameters. At site level, the mixed woodlands appear to have greater soil cover with AM plants and soil chemical characteristics similar to other forest environments in the same region, with an intermediate fungal diversity value. When the seasonal effect was analyzed, no changes were observed in the fungal richness and diversity index, whereas modifications were recorded in the class level, in the ecological guilds, and in certain soil parameters; the inversion of phyla should be highlighted. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the predominant phyla, and presented a tendency to an inversion between seasons: Ascomycota fungi predominated in autumn, while Basidiomycota were more abundant in summer. The Glomeromycota were not well represented in this study. The most abundant classes were Agaricomycetes, followed by Leotiomycetes, Sordariomycetes, and Tremellomycetes, with some changes in the proportions between the two seasons, which could be related to certain soil characteristics. The most abundant orders in both seasons were Agaricales, Helotiales, Mortierellales, and Filobasidiales, correlated with some soil characteristics. The ordination analysis (NMDS) showed a correlation between taxonomic assignation and some soil characteristics, and only between class seasons.

Restoration of these ecosystems to their savanna condition is seen as a way to reduce woody species encroachment and dangerous fuel loads, and restore community species composition. The management practices to achieve these goals typically involve thinning and prescribed fire. We assessed how thinning to reduce basal area combined with frequent prescribed fire influenced small mammal communities and their habitat. We focused on six habitat variables that can influence small mammal abundance and species composition: stand basal area of live trees and snags, volume of coarse woody debris, percent ground cover, forest floor depth, and distance of vulnerability, a measure of understory vegetation structure and animal vulnerability to predators. Although savanna restoration reduced basal area by 80%, there was no change in snag density or coarse woody debris volume. Savanna restoration significantly increased the ground cover of graminoids, forbs, bare ground, and down woody debris and reduced forest floor depth and distance of vulnerability. These habitat changes likely contributed to the significant differences between small mammal communities in restored and non-restored stands. Restoration treatments caused a large increase in abundance of White-footed Mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and important changes in community assemblages.

Such facilitation by fire of seedling establishment is known as the ""ashbed effect."" Because the ashbed effect might involve disruption of common mycorrhizal networks, we hypothesized that in the absence of fire, intact rain forest arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) networks inhibit E. tetrodonta seedlings. Although arbuscular mycorrhizas predominate in the rain forest, common tree species of the northern Australian savannas (including adult E. tetrodonta) host ectomycorrhizas. To test our hypothesis, we grew E. tetrodonta and Ceiba pentandra (an AM-responsive species used to confirm treatments) separately in microcosms of ambient or methyl-bromide fumigated rain forest soil with or without severing potential mycorrhizal fungus connections to an AM nurse plant, Litsea glutinosa. As expected, C. pentandra formed mycorrhizas in all treatments but had the most root colonization and grew fastest in ambient soil. E. tetrodonta seedlings also formed AM in all treatments, but severing hyphae in fumigated soil produced the least colonization and the best growth. Three of ten E. tetrodonta seedlings in ambient soil with intact network hyphae died. Because foliar chlorosis was symptomatic of iron deficiency, after 130 days we began to fertilize half the E. tetrodonta seedlings in ambient soil with an iron solution. Iron fertilization completely remedied chlorosis and stimulated leaf growth. Our microcosm results suggest that in intact rain forest, common AM networks mediate belowground competition and AM fungi may exacerbate iron deficiency, thereby enhancing resistance to E. tetrodonta invasion.

This feeding is apparently beneficial to the fungi as it results in dispersal of spores. As these fungi are in almost all cases ectomycorrhiza-forming species, mycophagy by mammals may play an important role in the maintenance of mycorrhizal symbiosis in Eucalyptus forests. Fire is frequent and a dominant ecological factor in these forests, and this study tested the hypothesis that fire triggers both increased sporocarp production by some hypogeous ectomycorrhizal fungi associated with eucalypts, and increased mycophagy by mammals. Three experimental burns were set in E. tenui-ramus forest in southeastern Tasmania. Digging activity (which reflects feeding on hypogeous fungi) by a mycophagous marsupial, the Tasmanian bettong Bettongia gaimardi, increased up to ten-fold after fire, with a peak about 1 month post-fire. This was associated with a similar pattern of increase in sporocarp production, which was due to species in the family Mesophelliaceae (especially Castoreum tasmanicum acid Mesophellia spp.). This family appears to have radiated in association with eucalypts and has an exclusively Australasian distribution, unlike many of the other ectomycorrhizal fungi collected in this study which are cosmopolitan and have broad host ranges. No B. gaimardi were killed by fire, and there was no increase in mortality following fire. Population density increased after fire as a result of immigration of adult males. However, body condition and fecundity of individual B. gaimardi were maintained at pre-fire levels. This suggests that the availability of energy to B. gaimardi increased as a result of fire, and the fact that the contribution of fungus to the diet of B. gaimardi was high on burnt relative to control sites suggests further that this increase in energy availability was provided by hypogeous fungi. Effects of fire on hypogeous fungi and B. gaimardi were short-lived; all measured variables returned to control values about 4 months after fire. The capacity of B. gaimardi to survive fire and to harvest the increased sporocarp production triggered by fire provides a mechanism for the rapid dispersal of spores after fire. This should result in the establishment of ectomycorrhizae very early in post-fire succession. Because only some species of ectomycorrhizal fungi fruited in response to burning, fire probably has a strong influence on community structure among ectomycorrhizal fungi.","YES",NA,"YES","YES","Article",NA,"YES",NA,NA,"Australia","interactions between fire mycophagous mammals and dispersal of ectromycorrhizal fungi in eucalyptus forests"

A thorough examination of site preparation treatments suggests that the changes in fungal species composition are driven by changes in the biology and chemistry of the soil environment after clearcutting as much as they are by loss or change in fungal inoculum.

Clearcut logging results in major changes in ectomycorrhizal fungal communities, but whether this results in the loss of key functional traits, such as those associated with nutrient acquisition from soil organic matter, is unknown. Furthermore, little is known about the importance of resource partitioning in structuring ectomycorrhizal fungal communities following disturbance because most research on these communities has focussed on life history strategies. By studying functional traits, such as activities of enzymes involved in the catabolism of organic macromolecules in soil, we can determine whether a physiological potential for resource partitioning exists in pioneer ectomycorrhizal communities and whether severe disturbance affects these important ecosystem services.2. We used activities of key hydrolytic enzymes in the ectomycorrhizospheres of Douglas-fir seedlings regenerating at clearcut sites as a functional trait to test whether these differed from those at recent wildfire sites or control forests. We sampled the most abundant types of ectomycorrhizas from 16-month-old seedlings from sites exposed to (i) low or (ii) high severity wildfire, (iii) sites that had been clearcut logged in the same year as the fire and (iv) sites that contained control stands of mature Douglas-fir. We expected differences in activities among ectomycorrhizas sampled from different disturbance treatments and among those formed by different fungal species.3. In spite of large differences in soil chemistry, activities of acid phosphomonoesterase, N-acetylglucosaminidase and beta-glucosidase, when averaged among the ectomycorrhizas sampled per site, were not affected by disturbance agent. However, activities varied up to sixfold among mycorrhizospheres of different fungal species on the same seedling. Multivariate analysis also indicated some consistent differences in enzyme profiles among ectomycorrhizas formed by specific fungal species, independent of treatment.4. The finding that ectomycorrhizal fungal communities exposed to different disturbance agents are functionally similar with respect to the activities of three mycorrhizosphere enzymes supports the conclusion that complementarity exists among ectomycorrhizal fungi. The substantial physiological diversity among ectomycorrhizal fungi at the scale of an individual seedling's root tips, especially at control mature forests, indicates the potential for resource partitioning within the ectomycorrhizal community and access to a wider range of nutrient sources by each seedling.5. Functional similarity among ectomycorrhizal fungal communities across a disturbance severity gradient suggests that dry interior Douglas-fir forests are resilient to severe disturbances such as high severity wildfire and clearcutting with forest floor removal. Moreover, our results suggest that current harvesting practices emulate natural disturbances with respect to site-level mycorrhizosphere enzyme activity. The large variation in activity among fungal species, however, indicates that a substantial simplification of the fungal community through other perturbations, as expected with climate change, has the potential to affect ecosystem function.","YES",NA,"YES","YES","Article",NA,"YES",NA,NA,"Canada","functional complementarity of douglasfir ectomycorrhizas for extracellular enzyme activity after wildfire or clearcut logging"

In savanna systems, Macrotermes termites, through forming spatially explicit mounds with unique woody plant assemblages, emerge as important sources of such heterogeneity. Despite a growing consensus regarding the importance of functional diversity (FD) to ecosystem processes, no study has quantified how termite mounds affect woody plant FD. We address whether termite mounds alter the distribution of functional traits, and increase FD of woody plant communities within Africa's largest savanna woodland, the 2.7 million km(2) miombo system. Using plant traits that change according to soil resources (for example, water and nutrients), and disturbance (for example, fire and elephant herbivory), we identified response functional groups and compared relative representation of these groups between mound and matrix habitats. We also asked whether mound and matrix habitats differed in their contribution to FD within the system.

Mound plant assemblages had greater response diversity to soil resources than matrix plots, but there was no difference in response diversity to disturbance. High trait values on mounds included tree height, leaf nitrogen, phosphorus, and palatability. Species with root ectomycorrhizae dominated the matrix.

Some wildfires and severe prescribed burns can have similar consequences, Such organic matter reductions can have important implications for soil chemical, biological and physical properties. A number of studies have linked substantial reduction in mycorrhizae development and tree growth to high levels of soil disturbance, or removal of organic horizons, Timber harvesting also removes a large percentage of coarse woody debris, which has unknown ramifications on soil productivity. Current woody residue guidelines in this region recommend leaving <10 to 125 Mg ha(-1) on site to replace woody materials lost during harvesting operations. Large amounts of soil nitrogen (>500 hg ha(-1)) can also be lost from timber harvesting and site preparation, especially when using prescribed flue. The time required to replace this lost nitrogen may range from <10 to >275 yr, and depends on the severity of site treatments, presence or absence of nitrogen fixing plants, and amounts of atmospheric deposition. Maintaining adequate amounts of organic matter on some forest sites in the Inland Northwest may temporarily increase the risk of wildfire or favor the activity of certain insects or disease fungi. However, carefully planned prescribed burns and mechanical site preparation can be practiced on most sites with relatively low impacts on soil organic levels, while accomplishing Vie important forest management objectives of fuel reduction, seedbed preparation, and reducing competing vegetation, Organic matter management will be the most difficult on very dry sites, with their historically low soil organic and nitrogen content, and high fire potential, The maintenance of adequate soil organic matter levels is critical for sustaining forest health and productivity under the variable moisture and temperature conditions of this region, Thus, soil organic components will become more important in the future as ecosystem management systems are developed for western forests.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"impacts of timber harvesting on soil organic matter nitrogen productivity and health of inland northwest forests"

Even though ectomycorrhizal fungi are known to be critical symbionts of young pines and are necessary for the development of healthy pines, virtually nothing is known about these mutualists and their role in pine establishment and survival in the pine rocklands. One approach to improve pine establishment is to grow seedlings in a nursery before outplanting, facilitating early associations with ectomycorrhizae, and therefore improving seedling health. In this study, we compared health metrics (height, stem diameter, final needle length, root length, root colonization, needle greenness, root volume, and root:shoot ratio) of seedlings grown in soil amended with five commercially available mycorrhizal inocula versus field soil collected from three pine rockland fragments.

(1) The loss of photosynthates through stress or tree mortality decreases the abundance of EM fungi and selects for less carbon-demanding species. (2) Pine introductions initiate establishment of novel EM fungal communities. (3) The extent of shifts in EM fungal abundance and community composition is mediated by surrounding vegetation. We find support for these hypotheses though changes in EM fungal abundance are variable and context-dependent. We posit that the consequences of shifts in EM fungal abundance and community composition extend beyond the individual tree to the landscape; these changes may affect population dynamics of both symbionts, ecosystem processes, and the conservation and evolution of fungi.

The purpose of this work is to investigate whether the practice of burning DOF stimulates the production of Astraeus sporocarps in DOF. Burned and unburned Astraeus habitat was surveyed over two years at two sites in Chiang Mai province and one site in Mae Hong Son province. Changes in soil fungi after a fire as well as vascular vegetation growing with Astraeus were studied. All sporocarps collected were identified as Astraeus odoratus. Astraeus sporocarps were found in both burned and unburned areas in 2010. In 2011, an unusually wet year, no sporocarps were found in burned or unburned areas.

Results show that the turnover time of soil carbon was longest in the area where fire occurred 2 years ago (117 years) and approximately two times shorter (ca. 60 years) in the areas where fire occurred 42,60 and 152 years ago.

However, fungi include several functional groups, and the responses of these groups to different forest disturbances is poorly understood. For example, ectomycorrhizal fungi may facilitate the establishment of a new tree cohort while saprotrophic fungi are able to decompose most of the dead organic material that result from the disturbance event. In this study, we examined how functionally different macrofungi respond to two major disturbances: fire (prescribed burning) and different intensities of timber harvest.We used large-scale field experiment where (1) fire and (2) harvest intensity were manipulated simultaneously in a factorial, replicated design. Three levels of harvests and an unharvested control were included, and sites were either burned or not. Fungi were surveyed before treatments in year 2000 and annually over three years (2001-2003) after the treatments. Fungi species were divided into ectomycorrhizal (ECM), saprophyte (SaM) and wood-associated fungi (WAM). The latter group mostly included Aphylloporoid wood-associated species (AWAM) and agarics. We observed also two biotrophic and one parasitic fungus but these were excluded from the assemblage-level analyses due to their rarity. Both number of sporocarps (fruiting bodies) and their biomass were measured.Fungal groups were affected by harvest and fire but the various fungal groups responded in different ways to the treatments. The ECM species were sensitive to timber harvests and disappeared from all the harvested sites. Fire in the unharvested sites did not negatively affect the ECM fungi. The SaM fungi responded quickly after disturbance, and their assemblage composition changed after fire and harvest. Species richness was reduced but fire promoted several pyrophilous SaM species, leading to major compositional changes in SaM species and the formation of distinct assemblages. The WAM species declined after harvests but fire tended to counteract the negative effects of timber harvesting.The results show that fungal groups respond in different ways to major disturbances in boreal forests. Early successional post-disturbance forests contribute to the maintenance of forest biodiversity, especially the specialist SaM species. However, the type of disturbance (fire or harvest) affect fungi in different ways.

However, in Algeria, the cork oak forests are highly threatened by repeated fires, overgrazing and the anthropogenic pressure that weaken the ecosystem of cork oak and affect its natural regeneration. This degradation results in an alteration of many ecological components of the cork oak, such as fungal communities in the soil. Thus, the aim of this work is to study the effects of cork oak stand degradation on the diversity of mycorrhizal communities associated with Quercus suber and some of its understory shrubs (Cistus monspeliensis, Lavandula stoechas and Thymus vulgaris) in the forest of Brabtia (northeastern Algeria). For this purpose, two sites were chosen: one degraded by the anthropogenic factors and the other non-degraded one. Moreover, it is suggested that some plants of the understory shrub vegetation of cork oak, such as the cistus, lavender and thyme, prove to be favourable to the juvenile growth of this tree. The results obtained showed that the ectomycorrhizal (EcM) root colonization of cistus was higher compared to that of cork oak in both stations. The estimation of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization showed significantly higher levels in the roots of cork oak, cistus, lavender and thyme in the degraded station compared with the nondegraded stations. In contrast, the rhizosphere soils of cork oak and cistus had low number of AM propagules and fungal spores, while under the roots of lavender and thyme, these two parameters were greatly improved with the abundance of the genera Glomus and Gigaspora.

The multiple factors of overgrazing, biological invasion by introducing acacia trees, and repeated fires weaken the cork oak ecosystem and affect its natural regeneration. The purpose of this study is to increase the production of cork oak. With this aim, a test of controlled mycorrhization was carried out on the nursery where two commercial inocula - the arbuscular mycorrhizal (Symbivit) (S) and ectomycorrhizal (Ectovit) (E) - were brought separately and combined on cork oak seedlings cultivated on sterilized or non-sterilized soil. Statistical models revealed that the controlled inoculation improved the growth of the plants inoculated by IE, which had significantly increased mycorrhizal root colonization levels and cork oak growth compared to the treatments of the Symbivit (IS) and the non-inoculated plants (NI); these rates were lower in both substrates: sterile and non-sterile. It is known that the best mycorrhizal partners of cork oak are ectomycorrhizae, however, in the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizae, the mycorrhizal root colonization levels and the growth parameters were considerably enhanced compared to previous treatments IE, IS and NI. The dual colonization had shown positive effects on the improvement of the mycorrhizal potential of the soil. Indeed, EM % colonization was the most strongly correlated with growth parameters compared to other mycorrhizal parameters.

Plants that dominate during this period of soil impoverishment have specialized strategies for P acquisition, including ectomycorrhiza or root clusters. We use quantitative, pollen-based reconstructions of regional vegetation in four Quaternary warm stages (Holocene, Eemian, Holsteinian, Harreskovian) to test whether inferred forest cover and productivity changes are consistent with long-term modification of soil nutrient pools.Location Southern Scandinavia (Denmark, southern Sweden).Methods The REVEALS model was used to estimate regional vegetation abundances of 25 pollen-type-equivalent taxa from pollen records of large sedimentary basins in southernmost Scandinavia. Based on the estimated regional vegetation, we then calculated time-series of Ellenberg indicator values for L (light), R (soil reaction) and N (a productivity proxy). We classified the vegetation records into distinct phases and compared these phases and the samples using hierarchical clustering and ordination.Results All three interglacials developed coniferous or mixed forests. However, pure deciduous forests were never reached during the Holsteinian, while pure coniferous forests never developed in the Holocene. Above-ground productivity was inferred to be low initially, peaking in the first third of the warm stages and then slowly declining (except during the Holocene). Dominant trees of the post-peak phases all had ectomycorrhiza as a strategy for P acquisition, indicating that easily accessible P pools had become depleted. Increases in fire regimes may have amplified the inferred final drop in productivity. Mid/late Holocene productivity changes were much influenced by agricultural activities.Main conclusions REVEALS vegetation estimates combined with Ellenberg indicator values suggest a consistent pattern in warm stages of initially rising productivity, followed by a long and slow decline. The P-acquisition strategies of dominant trees indicate that the decline reflects increasing P depletion of soils.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"soil phosphorus as a control of productivity and openness in temperate interglacial forest ecosystems"

The overall number of recorded species in studied post-fire variants comprised 52% (B), 41% (C) and 48% (R) of unburnt sites (U, 261 species). Significantly different species compositions were registered between C and B plots, while no difference was observed between C and R plots. Fungal communities of all burnt sites showed more significant differences stemming from annual changes rather than from types of forest management. Early succession of the post-fire fungal communities maintained the fungi from all defined taxonomical and functional groups. However, a certain alteration within some fungal life styles was observed. The wildfire has negatively impacted the lichens and the mycorrhizal species, as the percentages of these groups decreased from 15% and 12% in U plots to 10% and 3% in B plots.

This raises the question of when the advent of surface fires occurred compared with the introduction of other critical selective agents, such as frost, seasonal drought, crown fire, nutrient-impoverished soils, new habitat types, and novel pollinators, herbivores and dispersal agents. Of particular interest is the relative time of origin of traits associated with fire-free habitats that traditionally have been viewed as ancestral. We collated 47 paired time sequences for a wide range of clades most of whose species are fire-prone. The objective was to determine the order of origin of fire-related traits relative to the origin of other fire-related traits associated with different fire regimes or non-fire-related traits in response to selective agents unrelated to fire. The results show that the initiation of fire-related traits in response to moderate fires (trigger 1) preceded either a) other fire-related traits that represent responses to an increase in the intensity or frequency of fire (trigger 2) (10 comparisons), b) traits associated with fire-free habitats (12 comparisons), or c) novel traits associated with selective agents unlinked to fire, with the fire-related traits now stabilized (25 comparisons). The only exception was the presence of ectomycorrhizas among pines, which are diagnostic for Pinaceae, suggesting that adaptations to poor soils occurred before this highly fire-prone genus evolved. For some early traits, there was confounding with several possible key selective agents apparently acting concurrently, although fire was always present, and these await further clarification. We conclude that fire has had a pre-emptive role in shaping many specialized traits fundamental to plant survival among fire-prone clades and that other selective agents, such as summer drought, have had a secondary role in promoting the evolution of additional novel traits that increased fitness in more recent times.","MAYBE","Interesante de cara a entender la evolución","MAYBE","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"fire as a preemptive evolutionary trigger among seed plants"

In 1994 and 1995 I conducted a live-trapping survey at 152 sires throughout its potential geographic range. Detailed floristic, physiognomic, topographic and geology data from each site were used to develop a predictive model of bettong habitat requirements, using generalized linear modeling. Data from 62 spotlighting censuses and opportunistic observations were also used to assess potential threats to northern bettongs posed by introduced foxes Vulpes vulpes, while trapping and habitat data were employed to evaluate possible effects of rooting-damage from feral pigs and competition from rufous bettongs Aepyprymnus rufescens on northern bettong populations. The northern bettong was detected in only one area, the Lamb Range, where it was present at nearly half (33/70) of the sites surveyed. Sparse populations recorded previously at several other localities in north Queensland may have declined or disappeared. A multiple Poisson regression model indicated that northern bettongs were strongly associated with certain types of wet and mesic sclerophyll forests and woodlands, while rainforest and rainforest-invaded wet sclerophyll forests were avoided. Northern bettongs occurred only on infertile metamorphic and granitic substrates, and were never detected on richer basaltic or alluvial soils. This probably occurs because fruit-bodies of ectomycorrhizal fungi, which are a key food resource of northern bettongs, are most abundant on infertile soils. Foxes were never detected during the survey, and are unlikely to threaten northern bettong populations at present. Circumstantial evidence suggests that interspecific competition from rufous bettongs is also of minimal importance. Rooting damage by feral pigs, however, may be more significant; northern bettongs were rarely detected at sites with heavy pig damage, and this may be because pigs are also feeding on fungal fruit-bodies. At present, the greatest threat to northern bettongs is probably encroaching land development, especially in the crucial Lamb Range area. Northern Queensland is experiencing rapid population growth, and local shires are attempting to shunt residential development onto areas with infertile soils to avoid the lass of productive agricultural land. While normally a laudable practice, this is precisely the wrong policy in this specific region. A re-evaluation of the strategic development plans of local shires is urgently needed to protect remaining habitats of the northern bettong. Habitat management, especially regular burning, is also required in key bettong habitats. Burning will prevent further invasion of wet sclerophyll forests by rainforest vegetation, which renders the habitat unsuitable for bettongs, and also is likely to promote the local production of fungal fruit-bodies upon which the northern bettong is highly dependent.

Taxa were identified by internal transcribed spacer rDNA sequencing, and changes in community composition evaluated with non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS). Dissimilarities in the community data were tested for correlations with N variables. We observed a successional shift along NMDS axis 1 from such taxa as Suillus brevipes and Thelephora terrestris in sites age 5 and 11 to species of Cortinarius and Russula, among others, in the four older sites.

Our objective was to quantify the relationship between the abundance and diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungal sporocarps in the soil and in the diets of northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) in low-elevation forests of the eastern Washington Cascades. We randomly sampled four stands each of three cover types: dry open ponderosa pine, mesic young mixed-conifer forest, and mesic mature mixed-conifer forest. We sampled the soil for hypogeous sporocarps during the spring of 1999 and 2000. We collected fecal pellets from 318 flying squirrels live-trapped during the fall of 1997-2000. We sampled 2400 m(2) of soil surface and found truffles in 40% of 600 plots. Total biomass collected was 609 a. Spring truffle biomass on a kg/ha basis averaged 1.72 in open pine, 3.56 in young, and 4.11 in mature forest. Twenty-two species were collected across all cover types, with all but three species belonging to the Basidiomycotina. Eleven dominant species accounted for 91-94% of truffle biomass in each cover type. Four dominant species accounted for 60-70% of spring truffle biomass: Gautieria monticola, Hysterangium coriaceum, Rhizopogon parksii, and R. vinicolor. Truffle assemblages, richness and total biomass differed among cover types: richness and biomass were highest in young and mature mixed-conifer forest, and lowest in open ponderosa pine forest. Fall squirrel diets were composed of 23 genera or groups of fungi, plus about 22% plant material. Rhizopogon was the most abundant genus in the diet, followed by plant material, then Gautieria, Lencogaster. Alpova, and Hysterangium. Diets in different cover types were similar in the composition, richness, evenness, and the ratio of fungus to plant material. Diet richness varied over the study period. Nineteen truffle genera were detected in fall fecal samples versus 12 in spring soil samples. Management of low-elevation dry forest to maintain or restore stable fire regimes might reduce truffle diversity at stand scales by simplifying stand composition and structure; but, such management might increase long-term beta and landscape truffle diversity and persistence by reducing the occurrence of high-intensity fires and stabilizing inherent fire disturbance regimes.

Objective: We evaluated the healing efficacy of ZBSO and explored its possible mechanism on scalded rats. Materials and Methods: Sprague-Dawley rat models with deep second-degree burns were set up, and ZBSO (500 and 1000 mu l/wound) was topically applied twice daily for 7 days and then once daily until wound healing. The therapeutic effects of ZBSO were evaluated by observing wound closure time, decrustation time, wound-healing ratio, and pathological changes. Collagen type-III, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, phospho-nuclear factor-kappa B (p-NF-kappa B) p65, inhibitor of NF-kappa B subunit a p-I kappa alpha, and inhibitor of NF-kappa B subunit a (I kappa B alpha) expression were determined using Western blotting. Results: The ZBSO-treated group showed a higher wound-healing ratio and shorter decrustation and wound closure times than the untreated group. The topical application of ZBSO increased collagen synthesis as evidenced by an increase in hydroxyproline level and upregulated expression of collagen type-III on days 7, 14, and 21 posttreatment. A reduction in MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions also confirmed the collagen formation efficacy of ZBSO. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in superoxide dismutase levels and a decrease in malondialdehyde levels in ZBSO-treated wounds. ZBSO also decreased tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1 (IL-1) beta, and IL-6 levels in serum, upregulated I kappa B alpha, and downregulated p-NF-kappa B p65 and p-I kappa B alpha expression in vivo, indicating the anti-inflammatory action of ZBSO.

To begin to understand what might lead to such diversity, and to improve sampling designs, we investigated the spatial Structure of these communities. We used EMF community data from a number of studies carried out in seven mature and one recently fire-initiated forest stand. We applied various measures of spatial pattern to characterize distributions at EMF community and species levels: Mantel tests, Mantel correlograms, variance/mean and standardized variograms. Mantel tests indicated that in four of eight sites community similarity decreased with distance, whereas Mantel correlograms also found spatial autocorrelation in those four plus two additional sites. In all but one of these sites elevated similarity was evident only at relatively small spatial scales (<2.6 m), whereas one exhibited a larger scale pattern (similar to25 m). Evenness of biomass distribution among cores varied widely among taxa. Standardized variograms indicated that most of the dominant taxa showed patchiness at a scale of less than 3 m, with a range from 0 to greater than or equal to17 m. These results have implications for both sampling scale and intensity to achieve maximum efficiency of community sampling. In the systems we examined, cores should be at least 3 in apart to achieve the greatest sampling efficiency for stand-level community analysis. In some cases even this spacing may result in reduced sampling efficiency arising from patterns of spatial autocorrelation. Interpretation of the causes and significance of these patterns requires information on the genetic identity of individuals in the communities.

We found that the differences in the EMF community between the two sapling groups were mostly attributed to changes in the relative abundance of specific fungal species, with little species turnover. Specifically, Tomentella showed high abundance on pine roots, while Tuber, Russula and Sebacina were more common on the roots of cedars. The physical proximity to a specific host species was correlated with the EMF community composition of young saplings.

The effects of fire on certain above and belowground, biotic and abiotic components of these ecosystems have been previously documented, albeit belowground components have received much less attention. It has been suggested that the effects observed in the short-term after a fire usually differ from the longer-term effects. The long-term effects of fire (i.e. >5 years after burning) on belowground components in Nothofagus forests are currently unknown. In the present study we evaluated the long-term effect of fire on ectomycorrhiza (ECM) colonization and morphotype composition in N. pumilio roots, as well as soil chemical properties in temperate forests in Patagonia. Sampling was conducted in three mature monospecific forests. In each, nearby burned and unburned sites were selected. The time since the occurrence of fires differed between areas (i.e. 6-10 years). Within each site, 3 transects of 40 m were established randomly along which 5 samples of roots and soil were collected in spring and autumn. The main results were: (1) in comparison with the unburned site, ECM colonization was lower in the burned site in the area with the shorter time length since fire occurrence and no effects in the other two areas were observed; (2) richness and diversity were not significantly affected by fire but there was a significant effect of season for both parameters, being higher in spring; (3) ECM dominance was significantly higher in the unburned than in the burned site in Tronador, while in Challhuaco the opposite was observed, mainly in autumn; (4) in general carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous decreased while pH increased in the burned sites; (5) ECM colonization positively correlated with NH4+ and phosphorus and negatively with pH but was not significantly correlated with organic matter or any other soil variable. Altogether the results suggest that effects of fire on ectomycorrhiza and soil properties in N. pumilio forests are probably related to the time elapsed since fire occurrence combined with site characteristics.

We found that Agaricomycetes, Leotiomycetes, and Mucoromycotina are predominant fungi in the New Jersey Pine Barrens ecosystem, which is rich in root mutualistic fungi. We observed that the pygmy pine roots had significantly higher density of EcM tips than the regular pine roots. This was corroborated by our metabarcoding analysis, which showed that the pygmy pine trees had higher ratio of ectomycorrhiza-forming fungi than the regular-statured pines.

Because forest management activities can reduce ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungus diversity and forest regeneration success, management approaches are needed to sustain these essential forests organisms. We present selected results from experiments that test biodiversity assumptions behind current guidelines for ecosystem management. We examine contrasts in structural retention as they affect biodiversity and sporocarp production of EM fungi - a functional guild of organisms well suited as indicators of disturbance effects on below-ground ecosystems. overstorey removal significantly reduced EMF sporocarp production but, in contrast to the initial hypothesis, the effects were not always proportional to basal area retained. The effect of spatial pattern of retention varied between retention levels and mushroom and truffle sporocarp groups. Management implications include the need to address the conservation of rare truffle and mushroom species in a manner that recognizes their different responses to forest disturbance. We also raise the hypothesis that fire suppression may favour mushroom production over truffle production. Because fire seems to be important in the reproductive evolution of EMF, our results also add further impetus to the development of management plans that seek to restore forest health from the effects of decades of fire suppression. Experimental results suggest using dispersed green-tree retention in combination with aggregated retention to maintain sporocarp production. Such a mix ameliorates disturbance effects and may maintain higher levels of sporocarp production in the aggregates by reducing edge effects. It remains unclear how short-term reductions in sporocarp abundance will affect EM fungus populations for future forests. After disturbance, spores are a form of legacy and key to enabling adaptations by other species in the face of environmental change.

Although both Quercus and Cistus species are considered super-productive in terms of fungal production diversity, fungal diversity and productivity vary depending on the stand age and structure. The aim of this study was to assess the complementary mycological potential of these ecosystems by studying sporocarp production, diversity, and community composition to elucidate management practices that would enhance fungal diversity and productivity within a fire management framework. We collected sporocarps over a period of four consecutive years (2012-2015) in young Cistus plots (1-m tall Cistus), old Cistus plots (2-m tall Cistus), and Quercus Forest plots. Our analyses showed that age as well as dominant vegetation influences sporocarp production, diversity, and richness, with young Cistus stands most suited to high levels of sporocarp productivity and diversity. addition, a progressive restructuring of the fungal community was observed from a large, diverse community Cistus early-stage stands to a smaller, less diverse but well-defined community in Quercus stands, transiting through an intermediate composition in old Cistus fields. Based on our findings, we suggest that a management process that not only favors stand rejuvenation would achieve greater sporocarp production and richness, including edible commercial species, while reducing the amount of fuel.

Prior stable isotope analysis revealed variability in intrinsic water-use efficiency and nutritional status; however, small sample sizes prohibited the identification of geo-climatic effects on those isotopes. We summarize carbon isotope discrimination (Delta C-13, a measure of intrinsic water-use efficiency) and the natural abundance of delta C-13, delta N-15 and delta S-34 in whitebark pine nuts in the Northern Rockies. Spatial differences in geography, soil parent material and climate (e.g., summer mean temperature, number of degree-days below 0 degrees C, mean annual precipitation, Hargreaves climatic moisture deficit, and the frost-free period) contributed to the low to moderate spatial resolution in selected models (R-2 values ranged from 0.24 to 0.51). The importance of soil parent material in all models demonstrated whitebark pine exhibits previously unknown edaphic variation. Identification of the mechanistic drivers contributing to spatial heterogeneity in Delta C-13 provides an opportunity to select seed sources better suited to optimize long-term survival, vigor and cone production. Matching genetic resources to sites projected to support whitebark pine in future climates would ensure species persistence, while safeguarding an important wildlife food. Suitable wildlife habitat for projected warmer, drier climates was characterized as low values of Delta C-13 (<13.5 parts per thousand) and was concentrated in the southeastern portion of the Northern Rockies. Whitebark pine nuts at the landscape scale exhibited unique delta S-34 and delta N-15 values relative to other wildlife foods, but these isotope values can overlap other plant materials in more localized areas.

In this study, pots with a layer of charcoal in the middle of the soil profile promoted growth of the root system of the seedlings significantly more than did pots with no charcoal or with charcoal scattered throughout the soil. Along with the development of the root system, above-ground biomass and total biomass were also increased. Furthermore, in addition to the positive effects of charcoal in the soil, there were also strong positive effects on the growth of seedlings from ectomycorrhizal root formation. As a result, the largest above-ground biomass and total biomass were found for seedlings grown in layered charcoal with ectomycorrhizae. Furthermore, the highest phosphorus concentration in needles was also found for seedlings grown in layered charcoal with ectomycorrhizae. This is attributable to the frequent contact of roots with charcoal in the middle layer of the soil and the utilisation of phosphate by ectomycorrhizae.

In nutrient poor sites of this forest type canopy removal causes rapid growth of the ericaceous understorey plants transforming the forest community into ericaceous heath. Under the natural fire regime high severity fires are important to create the necessary mineral soil exposed seedbed for black spruce regeneration by removing phenolic rich Kalmia humus. Under the active fire suppression regime forest fires are generally small and they are non-severe compared to wild fires. Non-severe fires create very limited favourable seedbed for conifers but they stimulate vegetative growth of ericaceous plants specially Kalmia which has allelopathic effects on root growth and ectomycorrhiza formation in black spruce. One year after fire only 10% of the burned surface have mineral soil exposed seedbed that is suitable for black spruce germination and seedling establishment and the amount of suitable seedbed progressively declines with time since fire. The majority of the seedbed (90%) consists of charred surface that is unsuitable for seed germination. However, ericaceous plants can regenerate vegetatively through the charred surface. Post-disturbance black spruce regenerating sites are thus pre-empted by Kalmia, through its humus allelopathy and aggressive vegetative growth.

Ecosystem-level alleopathic effect has been argued as a cause for conifer regeneration failure by citing examples from a species-poor boreal forest in northern Sweden with ground vegetation dominated by crowberry (Empetrum hermaphroditum, Ericales) and New Zealand dairy pastures invaded by nodding or musk thistle (Carduus nutans). This article aims to explain the phenomenon of vegetation shift from conifer forest to ericaceous heath by extending the argument of ecosystem-level impact of ericaceous plants and linking the disturbance-mediated regeneration strategies of the dominant conifer species and the understory ericaceous species with the quality of seedbed substrate that influence the direction of secondary succession. It has been argued that fire severity plays a pivotal role in controlling seedbed quality and the regeneration mechanisms of conifers, which in turn determines the direction of post-disturbance succession. The post-fire-dominated ericaceous plants and their habitat-modifying effects have been explained from the point of view of keystone species concept and their role as ecosystem engineers. In the absence of high severity natural fires the canopy keystone species (conifer) fails to regenerate successfully mainly due to limitation of favorable seedbed.On the other hand, the understory ericaceous plants regenerate vigorously by vegetative methods from the belowground components that survived the fire. Forest harvesting by clearcutting or selective cutting also create similar vigorous vegetative regrowth of ericaceous plants, but conifer regeneration suffers from the lack of a suitable seedbed. Thus in the absence of successful conifer regeneration, the vigorously growing understory ericaceous plants become the new keystone species. The new keystone ericaceous species bring about a significant long-term habitat change by rapid accumulation of plyphenol-rich humus. Ericaceous phenolic compounds have been found to inhibit seed germination and seedling growth of conifers. By forming protein-phenol complexes they cause a further reduction of available nitrogen of the already nutrient-stressed habitat. A low pH condition in the presence of phenolic compounds causes the leaching of metallic ions and forms hard iron pans that impair soil water movement. The phenolic allelochemicals of ericaceous humus are also inhibitory to many conifer ectomycorrhizae. On the other hand, ericaceous plants perpetuate in the community by their stress-tolerating strategies as well as their ability to acquire nutrients through ericoid mycorrhizae. Three mechanisms working at the ecosystem level can be suggested as the cause of vegetation shift from forest to ericaceous heath. These are (1) the absence of high severity natural fire and the limitation of suitable conifer seedbed in the presence of thick humus, (2) increased competition resulting from the rapid vegetative regeneration of understory ericaceous plants after forest canopy opening by harvesting or nonsevere fire, and (3) habitat degradation by phenolic allelochemicals of ericaceous plants causing a soil nutrient imbalance and iron pan formation. Thus, a shift in keystone species from conifer to ericaceous plant in the post-disturbance habitat may induce a retrogressive succession due to ecosystem-level engineering effects of the new keystone species.Vegetation management in conifer-ericaceous communities depends on land management objectives. If the objective is to produce timber and other forest products then the control of ericaceous plants and site preparation is necessary after forest harvesting. Ploughing and liming followed by conifer planting and repeated N fertilization has been applied successfully to promote afforestation of Calluna heathlands in Britain. However, such practice has not been proven successful in the reforestation of Kalmia-dominated sites in eastern Canada. If, on the other hand, the land management objective is to maintain heathlands for herbivore production or conservation of cultural landscape, as in the case of certain Calluna-dominated heathland in Western Europe, then moderately hot prescribed burning is useful as a management tool.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"conifer regeneration problems in boreal and temperate forests with ericaceous understory role of disturbance seedbed limitation and keytsone species change"

Forest disturbance in nutrient stressed conifer-ericaceous communities in boreal and temperate forests become quickly dominated by ericaceous shrubs and restrict tree recruitment. Habitat filter due to limitation of safe sites has been attributed to inadequate seedling regeneration. Furthermore, large proportions of the regenerating seedlings exhibit stunted growth but some over time exhibit growth release. Despite wide occurrence of poor natural regeneration of conifers in ericaceous shrubs, the ontogenic patterns of stunting and growth release of conifer seedlings received little attention. We used post-fire black spruce- Kalmia ecosystems to study this. We hypothesized that (i) post-fire residual OM thickness controls seedling recruitment by limiting safe sites even in presence of sufficient seed supply, (ii) black spruce density of a site depends on its OM depth, which controls safe sites, and (iii) partially safe sites, which permit germination and seedling establishment with stunted growth, can become safe sites overtime allowing growth release. We experimentally tested black spruce seed regeneration on seedbeds with variable OM thickness and studied the ontogenic patterns of seedling/sapling growth in eight post-fire Kalmia heaths along an 8-34 year chronosequence. We found that despite ample seed supply OM depth controls seedling recruitment. In the chronosequence study we found only 17.8% of burnt area accounts for occupied safe sites, recruiting only 317 seedlings/ha and only 13% of them exhibit normal growth, others remain stunted for 5-20 yrs. With time, successive cohorts of stunted seedlings overcome growth check. Black spruce density was negatively associated with OM depth and Kalmia cover. The probability of growth release was associated negatively with OM depth and positively with soil respiration. We conclude that poor black spruce regeneration in Kalmia heath is largely due to safe site limitation controlled by OM depth, which also controls seedling stunting and growth release. The novelty of this work is the discovery of ontogenic patterns of conifer seedlings in nutrient stressed habitats. Our findings have implications for tree regeneration in other environmentally and nutritionally stressed ecosystems such as treelines.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"recruitment and ontogenic patterns of stunting and growth release of black spruce <i>picea<i> <i>mariana<i> in postfire <i>kalmia<i> heaths"

After four and a half years, the truffle-inoculated holm oaks maintained 36 % of their root tips colonized with T. melanosporum, and 10 years after plantations, 26.2 % of the surviving inoculated holm oaks displayed a ""truffle burn"" area. A greater ECM morphotype richness was associated with seedlings planted in plots with the presence of ECM host plants, whereas the T. melanosporum mycorrhizal ratio was constant.

Traditional forest use, such as coppicing to obtain firewood or livestock grazing under silvopastoral systems, and the current social abandonment of the rural environment have given rise to forest structures of different ages and at different stages of development. Thus, on the one hand, there are large areas of Q. pyrenaica coppice systems that produce a large amount of biomass that have a very high risk of driving forest fires. On the other hand, dehesas, which have very low tree density and are composed of very old trees that are susceptible to different types of environmental stress and have serious regeneration problems and a weak phytosanitary status. In addition, previous studies have suggested that the production of economically valuable edible mushrooms is negatively impacted by silvicultural management. To determine the effects of land management on these ecosystems, we analyzed the soil fungal communities associated with coppice stands (i.e., high-density coppice), high forest stands (i.e., low-density coppice that received silvicultural management 15 years ago to reduce the risk of wildfire), and old stands (i. e., dehesas) to assess their potential ecological roles in their conservation and the diversity of edible mushrooms. We also analyzed the edaphic variables associated with these systems (carbon, pH and the carbon/nitrogen ratio) to understand the dynamics of these fungal communities. We observed two distinguishable communities: pathogen-, parasite-, and endophyte-dominated dehesas and saprotroph-and ectomycorrhizal (ECM)-dominated coppice stands, with a mixed composition in high forest stands. ECM fungi correlated with stand age and structure, showing higher richness levels in high forest stands, particularly ECM fungi with short hyphal exploration type.

Chapters 4 provide examples of obligate, preferential and opportunistic mammalian mycophagists, further review the nutritional characteristics of fungi compared to other foodstuffs, and describe how differences in the digestive anatomy and physiology of mammalian species might help explain the degree to which such foods are utilized in nature. A detailed nutritional evaluation of mycophagy provided in Chapter 5, replete with anecdotal stories about animals dependency on hypogenous fungi for nourishment during part, most, or all of their lives.

The breadth of animals and fungal taxonomic information is a great source of reference material to trophic, food web, mammalian or mycological ecologists conducting research in the western US or Australian Eucalyptus forests.

Here it is designated oceanic temperate forest (OTF), its climatic envelope is defined, global distribution is assessed and origin is reviewed. Often described as Gondwanan or relic, tree genera characteristic of the OTF are more likely to be shared with tropical regions to the north than with temperate fragments of Gondwana (southern Australia, southern South America). The OTF arose out of the warm temperate to subtropical forests of Zealandia that formed during the Palaeogene. Warm, fire-prone environments in the middle Miocene permitted an influx of Australian taxa. During the Pliocene/Pleistocene increasingly cool climates, less fire and loss of old, leached soils, reduced floristic diversity. Many low-nutrient specialists and arid-adapted Australian-origin taxa were lost, along with many now exclusively tropical genera. Reduction in ectomycorrhizal tall tree genera left only Nothofagaceae and myrtaceous Kunzea and thus OTF formations are largely arbuscular mycorrhizal. Lack of fast-growing, ectomycorrhizal cold-tolerant trees is a key reason for the marked physiognomic differences between northern temperate broadleaved forests and those of the New Zealand OTF. The pronounced oscillations in extent of dry, cool habitats and warm, moist habitats in this isolated archipelago during the Pleistocene had a profound effect on the composition and distribution of the OTF. We suggest two drivers have strongly modified both geographic and trait distribution in the flora. First, glacial-interglacial asymmetry'trees adapted to harsh glacial climates have more difficulty persisting in the face of strong biotic competition in warm, wet interglacial landscapes than trees adapted to interglacials do in persisting in climatically protected sites in cold, dry glacial landscapes.

We review the literature on fire and fungi in Australia, collating studies that include sites with different time since fire or different fire regimes. The studies used a variety of methods for survey and identification of fungi and focussed on different groups of fungi, with an emphasis on fruit-bodies of epigeal macrofungi and a lack of studies on microfungi in soil or plant tissues. There was a lack of replication of fire treatment effects in some studies. Nevertheless, most studies reported some consequence of fire on the fungal community. Studies on fire and fungi were concentrated in eucalypt forest in south-west and south-eastern Australia, and were lacking for ecosystems such as grasslands and tropical savannahs. The effects of fire on fungi are highly variable and depend on factors such as soil and vegetation type and variation in fire intensity and history, including the length of time between fires. There is a post-fire flush of fruit-bodies of pyrophilous macrofungi, but there are also fungi that prefer long unburnt vegetation. The few studies that tested the effect of fire regimes in relation to the intervals between burns did not yield consistent results. The functional roles of fungi in ecosystems and the interactions of fire with these functions are explained and discussed. Responses of fungi to fire are reviewed for each fungal trophic group, and also in relation to interactions between fungi and vertebrates and invertebrates. Recommendations are made to include monitoring of fungi in large-scale fire management research programs and to integrate the use of morphological and molecular methods of identification.

We used plant functional traits responsive to disturbance and other traits associated with the capacity to re-colonise and form persistent seed banks as a means of assessing the effects of land-use change on soil seed banks. The soil seed bank and corresponding extant vegetation was surveyed within four replicated paired sites of fragmented native forest and abandoned farmland, and native forest and pine plantation. There was a significant difference in the composition of the soil seed bank for both land-use changes. Non-metric Multi-dimensional Scaling of plant attributes showed a clear separation of samples according to land-use type and between seed bank and extant vegetation. Cluster analysis of plant functional traits produced eight emergent groups. Phanerophytes were classified as either Ant-dispersed shrubs and herbs, Ericoid heaths or Eucalypts, perennial herbs were either Vertebrate-dispersed species, Barochorous annuals and herbs or Small-seeded hemicryptophytes and the remaining species were Wind-dispersed species or Small-seeded annuals. Small-seeded annuals dominated the soil seed banks and native phanerophytes with low specific leaf area, resprouting, ant-dispersal, large seed, and ericoid mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal associations formed a minor component of the soil seed bank for all land-use types. Sorensen Similarity between the vegetation and soil seed bank was low across all land-use types and was explained by the dominance of annuals in the soil seed bank and perennial species in the extant vegetation. Indicator species analysis revealed an increase in Wind-dispersed species, Barochorous species and Small-seeded annuals in the soil seed bank relative to extant vegetation. Trait associations include a therophyte life form (of predominantly introduced species) with high specific leaf area, small round seed, a seeder fire response, and arbuscular or non-mycorrhizal associations. Underlying axes in trait variation indicate seed banks were dominated by traits associated with the rapid acquisition of resources or the ability to respond rapidly to disturbance that provided for large and persistent stores of introduced ruderal species. In contrast, species excluded from the seed bank shared traits associated with the conservation of resources or ability to withstand environmental stress and were typical of native phanerophytes. These generalisable patterns in plant traits make it unlikely that eucalypt communities can be restored from the native soil seed bank alone. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated whether life form, mode of seed dispersal, leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA), nutrient uptake strategy, seed mass, fire response, plant height, and clonal spread differed between understorey species of pine plantation and native forest. Further, we asked whether plant functional traits that confer tolerance to stress through shading differ from those in other floras. The study was conducted on the Delatite Peninsula in north-eastern Victoria, Australia. Vegetation of adjacent native forest and pine plantation were surveyed using eight 7 m x 7 m plots per site, randomly located within five paired sites. Differences in plant traits between land-use types were tested by Non-metric Multi-dimensional Scaling (NMDS), analysis of similarity (ANOSIM)and paired t-tests. Cluster analysis of the nine plant traits was used to define emergent groups, with differences between land-use types examined by ANOSIM and indicator species analysis. There was a significant change in the composition of understorey vegetation following conversion to pine plantation that included a decline in the richness of native species. NMDS of plant attributes showed a clear separation of native forest from pine plantation with land use strongly correlated in ordination space (r(2) = 0.611). Cluster analysis produced seven emergent groups of plant functional traits for 78 identified plant species. Phanerophytes split into two groups (myrmecochorous trees and shrubs; myrmecochorous shrubs), perennial herbs into four groups (upright herbs, myrmecochorous herbs, barochorous herbs, flat rosette herbs) with one group representing therophytes and anemochorous perennials. Perennial herbs with intermediate SLA and clonal spread were tolerant of the shaded conditions in pine plantation while the two groups of phanerophytes and the myrmecochorous herbs were largely excluded. Shared traits of excluded emergent groups included those that provided an over-riding adaptation to mineral nutrient stress. including myrmecochory, low SLA, ectomycorrhizal and ericoid mycorrhizal associations and N-2-fixation.

The aim of the present work was to check whether certain treatments of root systems have any impact on Pinus sylvestris seedling establishment as compared with standard planting procedures. Treatments included: i) inoculation with vegetative mycelium of Cenococcum geophilum (CGV); ii) inoculation with vegetative mycelium of Suillus luteus (SLV); moreover, in each of those two treatments damp sphagnum peat / sand mixture was added to roots upon planting; iii) inoculation with basidiospores of S. luteus applied during preceding growing season in the nursery (SLB), and iv) standard planting, no treatment (control). A two hectare experimental plantation of P. sylvestris was established in the spring of 2007 on coastal dunes of the Curonian Spit in western Lithuania on a site of approx.100 year-old Pinus mugo plantation that one year previously was devastated by a forest fire and clear cut. The three treatments and control, comprising 2,500 seedlings each, were planted in rows as 16 replicates (5000 seedlings /ha). Results showed that after the first growing season seedling survival was poor in all treatments (5.1 - 30.0%), but seedlings in CGV, SLV and SLB showed respectively 591%, 533% and 196% better survival than no-treatment controls. Thus, inoculations with vegetative mycelia and addition of peat/sand mixture were by far the best, although the most labour-consuming. After two growing seasons, the proportion of ECM-colonised roots in treatments was 27.3 - 39.8%, while 22.5% in the controls, and observed ECM types resembled those from forest nurseries.

Few studies have followed the relative impacts of these treatments on the production and consumption of truffles in forest ecosystems, particularly in the Sierra Nevada of California. Using a full-factorial completely randomized design, we examined the short-term impacts of prescribed burning (no burn and burn), mechanical thinning (no thin, light thin, and heavy thin), and combinations of these treatments on the production of truffles and their consumption by lodgepole chipmunks (Neotamias speciosus Merriam) in a mixed-conifer forest of the southern Sierra Nevada of California.

Truffle frequency, biomass, and species richness, and truffle consumption by N. speciosus were lower in heavily thinned and thinned and burned plots than in those exclusively burned. These results suggest that either thinning or burning can reduce short-term truffle production and consumption, and potentially the dispersal of ectomycorrhizal spores by small mammals.

Moreover, we estimated that fungal productivity has also changed historically in some scattered areas where changes in climate over the years may have led to a decrease in productivity.

Here, we evaluated soil spore banks of ectomycorrhizal fungi from endangered Japanese Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga japonica) forests using bioassay approaches with congeneric P. menziesii and Pinus densiflora seedlings in combination with molecular identification techniques. Rhizopogon togasawariana was predominant in soil propagule banks and was found in all remaining P. japonica forests when assayed with P. menziesii, while no colonization of this fungus was observed on Pinus seedlings. Given the observed specificity of R. togasawariana for P. menziesii and its phylogenetic position within the Pseudotsuga-specific Rhizopogon lineage, its geographical distribution is likely restricted to the remaining Japanese Douglas-fir forests, indicating a high extinction risk for this fungus as well as its endangered host. Spore banks of R. togasawariana remained highly infective after preservation for 1 year or heat treatment at 70 A degrees C, suggesting an ecological strategy of establishing ectomycorrhizal associations on regenerating Japanese Douglas-fir seedlings after disturbance, as observed in other Rhizopogon-Pinaceae combinations. Therefore, the regeneration of Japanese Douglas-fir seedlings may depend largely on the soil spore banks dominated by R. togasawariana, which has co-evolved with the Japanese Douglas-fir for over 30 million years.

Our experiment revealed positive and negative effects on growth of seedlings, and highlights the importance of biotic interactions in balsam fir establishment.Background and Objectives: In a context of climate change, understanding tree migration can be examined through changes in tree regeneration. At the ecotone between mixed and conifer boreal forest, regeneration of balsam fir northward is of particular interest because it thrives better under aspen-dominated stands as compared to adjacent spruce-dominated stands. As the understorey differs between these stands, with more Ericaceae under spruce and different ectomycorrhizal fungal communities in organic and mineral horizons, we hypothesized that biotic factors could explain differences in balsam fir establishment.Materials and Methods: Using a growth chamber experiment, we tested if differences in soil layers and modification of soil fungal communities would affect germination, mycorrhization, and growth of balsam fir seedlings in three different stand vegetation. We compared 12 treatments and followed 120 seedlings over three growth seasons.Results: We found similar survival in soils from aspen- and spruce-dominated stands, and a greater biomass on organic layers. In addition to this, a greater mycorrhization rate was found in aspen soils but improved germination in spruce soils. The presence of Ericaceae in spruce soils was associated with lower mycorrhization but did not affect other traits. Sterilization and therefore microorganisms affected mainly the number of ectomycorrhizae and the investment in root biomass. Finally, mycorrhization and biomass were correlated, but independent from N nutrition measured in needles.Conclusions: Our results highlighted the positive effects of organic soil layers and of mycorrhization on biomass, and showed that mycorrhization was increased under aspen as compared to other stand types. Our experiment also revealed positive effects of spruce soil on fir germination and showed that fir was able to grow and survive in all conditions.

Further, pile burning following clear-cut harvesting can create persistent openings dominated by nonwoody plants surrounded by dense regenerating conifer forest.

Fine-scale changes in the soil microbiome mirrored aboveground shifts in vegetation, with short-term changes to microbial carbon cycling functions resembling a postfire microbiome (e.g. enrichment of aromatic degradation genes) and respiration in burn scars decoupled from substrate quantity and quality. Broadly, however, soil microbiome composition and function within burn scar soils converged with that of the surrounding regenerating forest six decades after the disturbances, indicating potential microbial resilience that was disconnected from aboveground vegetation shifts.

Observations were conducted on three permanent plots that represented unburnt (Control), lightly burnt (LB) and severely burnt (SB) sites. At the time of this study, the SB site was occupied mainly by ferns and macarangas. Ferns and macarangas also occupied part of LB site, while the unburnt Control remained occupied by dipterocarp trees. Observations of fruiting bodies and ectomycorrhizal roots revealed that the ectomycorrhizal fungi were present only on the unburnt site and on that part of the LB site where the host trees remained.

Greatest infection level was on the control site, with a lesser level on LB and the lowest on the SB site. The absence of ectomycorrhizal fungi on the SB site might inhibit efforts to revegetate this area with dipterocarps.

Woodland management is often heavily focused on thinning and burning nontarget species to reduce competition and promote oak dominance in the overstory. These techniques have typically been developed in temperate regions, such as eastern U.S. forests, but whether they are the most effective strategy for promoting oak regeneration in semiarid woodlands has not been sufficiently examined. We conducted our study on the eastern Edwards Plateau in central Texas, where several oak species are codominant with Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei) over karst limestone terrane. These juniper-oak woodlands provide habitat for many endemic species and play an essential role in the maintenance of key aquifers. A history of canopy clearing and a severe drought in 2011 generated patches of living and dead juniper-oak canopy interspersed with canopy gaps in our study area. In November 2013, we planted 200 shin oak (Quercus sinuata var. breviloba) acorns in each of three habitat treatments, replicated six times: (1) live canopy, (2) dead canopy, and (3) open invasive grassland. We monitored emergence and survival each year, harvesting five seedlings from each replicate in October 2017 to assess shoot height, rooting depth, biomass, ectomycorrhizal colonization, and foliar nutrients. Canopy trees, living or dead, significantly enhanced seedling emergence and survival. Survival was positively associated with increasing Ashe juniper and oak basal area, shrub cover, and soil organic matter, and negatively associated with increasing canopy gap size (complete mortality in gaps >220 m(2)). Seedling biomass increased significantly in dead and open treatments along with foliar nutrients N, P, and S (dead treatments) or S and Fe (open treatments), whereas ectomycorrhizal colonization and foliar nutrients Ca, Mg, and Mn increased under living canopy. Our findings suggest that oak regeneration in these juniper-oak woodlands closely resembles that of Mediterranean regions, where canopy facilitates seedling survival. Both living and dead trees and shrubs enhanced oak regeneration, with seedling survival depending on proximity to larger trees, living roots, shrubs, and juniper-oak canopy. Planting acorns under canopy is an inexpensive, sustainable, and effective restoration practice in drought-prone ecosystems.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"native tree and shrub canopy facilitates oak seedling regeneration in semiarid woodland"

Global warming and drying have markedly enhanced in most forests the risk of fires across the world, which can affect the taxonomic and functional composition of key tree-associated organisms such as ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. The present study was conducted to characterise the alterations in the extent of root ECM colonisation, the ECM fungal communities, and their exploration types (i.e., indicator of ECM soil foraging strategies) in regenerated pines within a burned site as compared with an unburned site (five years after the fire event) in the Forest District Myszyniec, Poland. Methods. To assess the ECM fungal communities of burned and control sites, soil soil-root monoliths were collected from the study sites in September 2019. A total of 96 soil subsamples were collected for soil analysis and mycorrhizal assessment (6 trees x 2 sites x 4 study plots x 2 microsites (north and south) = 96 subsamples). Results. The percentage of root ECM colonisation was significantly lower in the burned site in comparison with the unburned (control) site. However, the ECM species richness did not differ between the control and burned sites. The identified ECM species in both sites were Imleria badia, Thelephora terrestris, Russula paludosa, R. badia, R. turci, R. vesca, Lactarius plumbeus, Phialocephala fortinii, and Hyaloscypha variabilis. The most frequent species in the burned and control sites were I. badia and T. terrestris, respectively. The relative abundances of contact, medium-distance smooth and long-distance exploration types in the burned site were significantly different from the control site, dominated by the medium-distance exploration type in both sites. The abundance of the long-distance exploration type in the burned site was markedly greater (27%) than that of the control site (14%), suggesting that the fire event had favoured this ECM foraging strategy. The results demonstrated that the fire led to reduced ECM colonisation of Scots pine trees in the burned site whereas the species richness was not affected, which can be attributed to degrees of fire-resistance in the ECM species, survival of ECM propagules in deeper soil layers, and/or continuous entry of spores/propagules of the ECM fungi from the adjacent forests via wind, water run-off or animals.","YES",NA,"YES","YES","Article",NA,"YES",NA,NA,"Poland","postfire dynamics of ectomycorrhizal fungal communities in a scots pine pinus sylvestris l forest of poland"

In Australia, the 2019-2020 fire season consumed nearly 50% of Kangaroo Island, South Australia, burning both dry sclerophyll woodland and adjacent historically cleared and grazed pastureland. Due to exacerbated fire regime elements, e. g., intensity and area affected, and interactions with historical land use, post-fire recovery of soil function was uncertain. This study assessed the impacts of a) the 2019-2020 fire event in Western River, Kangaroo Island on dry sclerophyll woodland and b) the interaction between this fire event and historical clearing and grazing on post-fire function of the soil. To do so, the following physicochemical and biological soil properties were analysed: labile active carbon, total carbon, total nitrogen, carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N), pH, electrical conductivity, soil water repellency, aggregate stability, microbial community composition, and microbial diversity. Our results showed that the fire was of high severity, causing a reduction in nutrient content, an extreme rise in pH, and significant modifications to fungal communities in burnt compared to unburnt dry sclerophyll woodland. Furthermore, clearing and grazing raised post-fire soil nutrient levels and soil microbial diversity but reduced soil C/N and the abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi in burnt pastureland compared to burnt woodland soils. This study highlights the role of management and fire severity in post-fire outcomes and emphasizes the need for comprehensive soil function assessments to evaluate the impacts of disturbance on soil. Taking direct measure of soil properties, as done here, will improve future assessments of fire season impacts and post-fire recovery in fireprone landscapes.","YES",NA,"YES","YES","Article",NA,"YES",NA,NA,"Australia","fire and land use impact soil properties in a mediterranean dry sclerophyll woodland"

Building upon the work of Ondik et al. (2022b) this study aims to 1) identify soil physicochemical properties impacted by fire and land management that are indirect drivers of changes to soil microbial community composition and 2) determine whether the observed changes to soil microbial community composition affect soil microbial functions. Via a redundancy analysis, we identified fire and management-induced changes to pH, soil water repellency, nutrient stoichiometry, and total nutrient content as significant drivers of the composition of soil microbial communities. We then measured basal respiration, substrate induced respiration, and the carbon mineralisation quotient, and calculated functional trait distributions among microbial communities by linking 16S and 18S rRNA sequences to respiration modes and functional guilds, respectively. We found that fire re-duced soil microbial respiration and the relative abundance (RA) of microbial symbionts, anaerobic bacteria, and microaerophilic bacteria, while increasing the RA of aerobic bacteria. Furthermore, management increased the RA of post-fire ectomycorrhizal fungi and may have reduced pathogenic load, microbial efficiency, and wood saprotrophs, while increasing litter, soil, and other saprotrophic species that are adapted to grasslands. This study shows that, through changes to microbial community composition, high severity wildfire and land management affected soil res-piration rates, bacterial modes of respiration, prevalence of symbiotic bacteria and fungi, and microbial substrate pref-erence. Having identified the main physicochemical drivers of changes to microbial community composition, we provide valuable insights into how fire and land management can impact soils in Mediterranean woodland.","YES",NA,"YES","YES","Article",NA,"YES",NA,NA,"Australia","soil microbial community composition and functions are disrupted by fire and land use in a mediterranean woodland"

The experiment was implemented as a 2 x 2 factorial design, including two R. maximum canopy removal levels (cut vs. not cut) combined with two forest floor removal levels (burned vs. not burned). These treatments were designed as potential management strategies to facilitate hardwood tree establishment in forests that have experienced T. canadensis declines. We sampled soils after removals and characterized bacterial and fungal communities using amplicon sequencing. Shrub removal did not affect bacterial or fungal alpha diversity but did affect both bacterial and fungal community composition. Relative abundances of bacterial phyla and fungal classes exhibited no differences among R. maximum removal treatments. However, specific bacterial and fungal taxa that were responsive to R. maximum removal (i.e., differentially abundant sequences) did exhibit clear patterns at high taxonomic levels. Specifically, taxa that responded negatively to R. maximum removal were found primarily in two bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes) and one fungal class (Archaeorhizomycetes) while positive responders were clustered in several other bacterial phyla (e.g., Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, Cyanobacteria). Fungal functional guilds also responded to R. maximum removal, including negative responses of ericoid mycorrhizae and positive responses of arbuscular mycorrhizae and wood saprotrophs. Effects of R. maximum removal on soil microbial communities were minor overall, but clear effects on some key functional groups were evident (i.e., mycorrhizal fungi), suggesting that microbial responses to R. maximum removal may influence recovery of forests in the southern Appalachian region.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"effects of rhododendron removal on soil bacterial and fungal communities in southern appalachian forests"

These wildfires can remove large, contiguous patches of mature forests, alter dominant plant communities and increase woody debris, potentially altering fungal community composition. Additionally, post-fire conditions may shift dominant fungal functional groups from plant-symbiotic ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi to more decomposer saprotrophic fungi. We investigated the long-term (13 years post-wildfire) effect of fire severity on 1) fungal sporocarp density, functional groups and community composition and 2) EM colonization and community composition from naturally regenerating ponderosa pine seedlings on the Pumpkin Fire that burned in 2000 in Arizona, USA. Plots were located in four burn severity classes: unburned, moderate-severity, and two high-severity (defined as 100% tree mortality) classes, either adjacent to residual live forest edges (edge plots), or >200 m from any residual live trees (interior plots). We found that high-severity burn plots had a unique sporocarp community composition, and a shift in dominant sporocarp functional groups, with 5-13 times lower EM sporocarp densities, and 4-7 times lower EM sporocarp species richness compared to unburned and moderate-severity plots. In contrast, saprotrophic sporocarp densities and richness were similar among burn severity classes, even with the large amount of coarse wood in the high-severity burn patches. Regenerating ponderosa pine seedlings had similar EM colonization and richness among severity classes, yet high-severity interior plots had a different community composition and a lower relative abundance of EM species compared to moderate-severity burn plots. Taken together, our results suggest that large patches of high-severity fire have long-term consequences for both EM sporocarp and root tip communities. Because EM fungal species vary in function, the limited species pool available in interior high-severity burn patches may influence pine recovery.","YES",NA,"YES","YES","Article",NA,"YES",NA,NA,"USA","large highseverity burn patches limit fungal recovery 13 years after wildfire in a ponderosa pine forest"

Based on field and greenhouse experiments, we compared germination and growth of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) on feather mosses (primarily Pleurozium schreberi) and lichens (primarily Cladonia stellaris), using bare mineral soil as a control. Drivers were investigated by (1) manipulating nutrient supply, (2) simulating shade of a closed canopy on the ground layer with the assumption this would mitigate lichen influence on pine growth, and (3) examining pine root ectomycorrhizal colonization and diversity as indicators of pine ability to take up nutrients. Total growth of 6-month-old greenhouse and 2-3-year-old field seedlings, as well as belowground growth of 2-year-old greenhouse seedlings, was significantly greater in moss than in lichen. Seed germination was not affected by ground cover type. Although field phosphorus and base cation availability was greater in mosses than in lichens, fertilization did not entirely compensate for the negative effects of lichens on pine growth in the greenhouse. Ground layer shading had no impact on pine growth. Lichens were associated with reduced abundance and modified composition of the root ectomycorrhizal community. By suggesting that terricolous lichens constitute a less favorable growth substrate than mosses for pine, our results support the hypothesis that lichens contribute to open woodland stability in the potentially closed-crown feather moss forest.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lichens contribute to open woodland stability in the boreal forest through detrimental effects on pine growth and root ectomycorrhizal development"

This is particularly interesting in the case of mutualisms because changing environmental conditions may be a source of evolutionary or ecological instability in the relationship between symbiotic partners. For the mycorrhizal symbiosis, elevated nutrient levels may make the carbon cost to plants of supporting mycorrhizal fungi outweigh the benefits of mycorrhizal nutrient acquisition. In this study, we simulated the effects of post-fire nutrient enrichment on the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis between Rhizopogon occidentalis and Pinus muricata by using factorial combinations of soil heating, ash addition and mycorrhizal colonization. In general, the presence of R. occidentalis and the heat and ash treatments increased growth of P. muricata seedlings. However, significant interactions between the treatments indicated that there were context-dependent effects on seedling growth. Soil heating increased soil mineral nitrogen content, but did not decrease the benefit of mycorrhizal colonization relative to unheated controls. This appeared to be driven by a decrease in the proportion of the root system occupied by R. occidentalis, indicating that host-plants can optimize colonization in a way that maximizes growth. Because seedlings in heat-treated soils were larger than unheated controls, reduced percent colonization did not cause any decrease in fungal biomass in heat-treated soils. Since there was no decrease in the performance of either partner, our results show that, in this system, ectomycorrhizal mutualisms are likely robust within the natural degree of environmental variability caused by moderate intensity wildfires.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"testing the ecological stability of ectomycorrhizal symbiosis effects of heat ash and mycorrhizal colonization on pinus muricata seedling performance"

For this reason, observational studies often fail to elucidate the primary mechanism by which disturbance modifies assembly structure. This is particularly true of microbial systems where reduction in biomass or removal of competitive dominants is not visually obvious.Fire is a major disturbance in pinaceous forests, which are characterized by ectomycorrhizal fungal root associations. To determine the specific mechanisms through which this disturbance affects ectomycorrhizal communities, we experimentally simulated the effects of fire by growing seedlings in field soil exposed to factorial combinations of soil heating and ash addition. Ectomycorrhizal colonists in each of the treatments were then identified from seedling roots using DNA sequences.Both soil heating and ash addition caused changes to the soil chemical environment and altered the fungal assemblages found on seedling roots. The effect on the ectomycorrhizal assembly was most pronounced from soil heating, which caused an overall simplification and increasing dominance by a few taxa with ruderal life-history strategies.We also conducted a follow-up experiment to see whether selective mortality of ectomycorrhizal spores might contribute to these patterns. Heat exposure had strong negative effects on all species tested. However, spore heat tolerance was highest for the species that showed the greatest increase in abundance on seedlings grown in heated soils.Synthesis. Fire alters below-ground communities through changes in soil chemistry and mortality of resident organisms.

MFM-5-Scale classification of a full set of 25 forest and non-forest classes adhering to Global Observation of Forest Cover (GOFC) specifications was in 80% agreement with the ECM product (n = 11,442). This is viewed as a significant result given the ambitious and detailed nature of the classes considered (21 forest classes comprising 12 species and density specific conifer and deciduous classes, four mixed forest classes and five burnt forest classes, as well as four non-forest classes). The two products were also in 94% agreement for 6 forest density classes (it = 3730). MFM-5-Scale biophysical analysis of 63 BOREAS plots showed LAI was estimated within +/- 0.53 LAI compared with ground-based TRAC LAI validation data (biophysical information is not provided by ECM). These results represent significant progress towards defining an operational landcover and biophysical estimation approach given the objective, semi-automated nature of MFM-5-Scale physical scene modeling compared to subjective, user-driven methods such as ECM.

What is the role of different functional traits in maintaining plant diversity under changing environmental conditions in seasonally dry and fire-prone environments?Location: Southwest Western Australia.Methods: Plant species abundance and soil nutrients were determined at 16 forest sites with variable fire histories across an aridity gradient. All plant species were classified based on their functional traits as (1) perennial or annual, (2) ectomycorrhizal, arbuscular mycorrhizal, ericoid mycorrhizal, orchid mycorrhizal, proteoid or other non-mycorrhizal, (3) resprouters or seeder, and (4) nitrogen fixer or non-fixer. We used a multivariate (fourth-corner) technique to simultaneously test the significance and direction of the relationship between each of these traits and fire frequency, fire interval length, aridity, and soil N, P and C fractions.Results: The functional response of the vegetation to fire regime was minor and restricted to annual species, which comprised only similar to 4% of taxa. Proteoid and ectomycorrhizal species dominated over species with arbuscular and orchid mycorrhizal roots, N-fixers dominated over non-fixers, and seeders dominated over resprouters when N fertility was low but organic labile P was high. Further, proteoid and ectomycorrhizal species richness increased with aridity, while arbuscular mycorrhizal species richness decreased.Conclusions: While the functional composition of southwest Australian vegetation is largely insensitive to changes in fire regime, nutrient acquisition and, to a lesser extent, regeneration traits provide mechanisms for the vegetation community to adjust to changes in resource availability. Thus, diversity responses to environmental change in seasonally dry and fire-prone ecosystems are likely to be primarily mediated by the composition of nutrient acquisition traits in the vegetation community.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"plant functional traits along environmental gradients in seasonally dry and fireprone ecosystem"

Variability in the sensitivity of tree communities to multi-decadal changes in fire regimes is critical to anticipating shifts in ecosystem structure and function, yet remains poorly understood. Here, we address the overall effects of fire on tree communities and the factors controlling their sensitivity in 29 sites that experienced multi-decadal alterations in fire frequencies in savanna and forest ecosystems across tropical and temperate regions. Fire had a strong overall effect on tree communities, with an average fire frequency (one fire every three years) reducing stem density by 48% and basal area by 53% after 50 years, relative to unburned plots. The largest changes occurred in savanna ecosystems and in sites with strong wet seasons or strong dry seasons, pointing to fire characteristics and species composition as important. Analyses of functional traits highlighted the impact of fire-driven changes in soil nutrients because frequent burning favoured trees with low biomass nitrogen and phosphorus content, and with more efficient nitrogen acquisition through ectomycorrhizal symbioses. Taken together, the response of trees to altered fire frequencies depends both on climatic and vegetation determinants of fire behaviour and tree growth, and the coupling between fire-driven nutrient losses and plant traits.Using tree community data from 29 tropical and temperate sites that have experienced multi-decadal alterations in fire frequency, the authors show repeated burning generally reduces stem density and basal area, with most pronounced effects in savanna ecosystems and in sites with strong wet seasons or strong dry seasons.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"decadal changes in fire frequencies shift tree communities and functional traits"

However, quantitative data on how managed forests sustain and recover from recent fire disturbance are limited.Two years after a large wildfire in managed even-aged boreal forests in Sweden, we investigated how recovery of aboveground and belowground communities, that is, understory vegetation and soil microbial and faunal communities, responded to variation in the severity of soil (i.e., consumption of soil organic matter) and canopy fires (i.e., tree mortality).While fire overall enhanced diversity of understory vegetation through colonization of fire adapted plant species, it reduced the abundance and diversity of soil biota. We observed contrasting effects of tree- and soil-related fire severity on survival and recovery of understory vegetation and soil biological communities. Severe fires that killed overstory Pinus sylvestris promoted a successional stage dominated by the mosses Ceratodon purpureus and Polytrichum juniperinum, but reduced regeneration of tree seedlings and disfavored the ericaceous dwarf-shrub Vaccinium vitis-idaea and the grass Deschampsia flexuosa. Moreover, high tree mortality from fire reduced fungal biomass and changed fungal community composition, in particular that of ectomycorrhizal fungi, and reduced the fungivorous soil Oribatida. In contrast, soil-related fire severity had little impact on vegetation composition, fungal communities, and soil animals. Bacterial communities responded to both tree- and soil-related fire severity.Synthesis: Our results 2 years postfire suggest that a change in fire regime from a historically low-severity ground fire regime, with fires that mainly burns into the soil organic layer, to a stand-replacing fire regime with a high degree of tree mortality, as may be expected with climate change, is likely to impact the short-term recovery of stand structure and above- and belowground species composition of even-aged P. sylvestris boreal forests.","YES",NA,"YES","YES","Article",NA,"NO","Off_topic","Microbial communities do not address fungal community","Sweden","fire severity as a key determinant of aboveground and belowground biological community recovery in managed evenaged boreal forests"

Severe crown-fire led to replacement of ectomycorrhizal- and litter-associated fungi by stress-tolerant ascomycetes. Elevated activities of hydrolytic enzymes in burned areas were correlated with root-associated ascomycetes and moulds, suggesting opportunistic exploitation of labile organic substrates. Fire did not, however, increase the abundance of more potent basidiomycete decomposers in the organic layer, nor did it enhance organic matter oxidation by fungal peroxidases, indicating that the potential for major post-fire losses of carbon due to stimulated decomposition is limited. Rather, peroxidase activity was low in burned areas, likely reflecting the absence of ectomycorrhizal fungi.

In Mediterranean forests, mutualistic feedbacks between trees and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, essential for ecosystem dynamics, might be shaped by recurrent fires. We tested how the structure and function of ECM fungal communities ofPinus pinasterandPinus halepensisvary among populations subjected to high and low fire recurrence in Mediterranean ecosystems, and analysed the relative contribution of environmental (climate, soil properties) and tree-mediated (serotiny) factors. For both pines, local and regional ECM fungal diversity were lower in areas of high than low fire recurrence, although certain fungal species were favoured in the former. A general decline of ECM root-tip enzymatic activity forP. pinasterwas associated with high fire recurrence, but not forP. halepensis. Fire recurrence and fire-related factors such as climate, soil properties or tree phenotype explained these results. In addition to the main influence of climate, the tree fire-adaptive trait serotiny recovered a great portion of the variation in structure and function of ECM fungal communities associated with fire recurrence. Edaphic conditions (especially pH, tightly linked to bedrock type) were an important driver shaping ECM fungal communities, but mainly at the local scale and probably independently of the fire recurrence.

The inspection of postfire trends in the diversity of ecological communities incorporating phylogenetic information allows to better understand the mechanisms driving fire resilience. While fire reduces plant phylogenetic diversity based on the recruitment of evolutionarily related species with postfire seed persistence, it increases that of soil microbes by limiting soil resources and changing the dominance of competing microbes. Thus, during postfire community reassembly, plant and soil microbes might experience opposing temporal trends in their phylogenetic diversity that are linked through changes in the soil conditions. We tested this hypothesis by investigating the postfire evolution of plant and soil microbial (fungi, bacteria and archaea) communities across three 20-year chronosequences. Plant phylogenetic diversity increased with time since fire as pioneer seeders facilitate the establishment of distantly related late-successional shrubs. The postfire increase in plant phylogenetic diversity fostered plant productivity, eventually recovering soil organic matter. These shifts over time in the soil conditions explained the postfire restoration of fungal and bacterial phylogenetic diversity, which decreased to prefire levels, suggesting that evolutionarily related taxa with high relative fitness recover their competitive superiority during community reassembly.

This study investigated the potential role of facilitation for the establishment of Pinus albicaulis (whitebark pine), a dominant Rocky Mountain tree species that is in decline due to an exotic blister rust disease (Cronartium ribicola), bark beetle outbreaks, and fire suppression. Surveys were conducted at five subalpine sites for spatial associations between naturally regenerating P. albicaulis seedlings and other plant species, and found that the cover of Vaccinium scoparium was higher in proximity to P. albicaulis seedlings. In transplant experiments, survival of P. albicaulis seedlings was higher when planted with V. scoparium and in shade cloth treatments, but neither survival nor growth rates were altered by clipping or rhizome severing of V. scoparium, suggesting a below-ground rather than above-ground facilitation mechanism. In contrast, Carex species reduced the survival and growth rates of P. albicaulis. In a fertilization experiment, no effect of nitrogen and/or phosphorous fertilization was found on Pinus albicaulis seedling growth, but seedlings growing with V. scoparium had higher growth rates and increased leaf phosphorus concentrations relative to seedlings growing in bare ground. In a microcosm experiment, P. albicaulis seedlings growing with V. scoparium had higher growth rates and leaf phosphorus concentrations than when grown alone, but only if P. albicaulis needles were added on the soil surface. My results suggest success of restoration plantings of greenhouse grown P. albicaulis seedlings may be improved by planting in areas where V. scoparium occurs, and avoiding areas dominated by Carex species. Removal of adjacent vegetation prior to planting seedlings may be ineffective in significantly altering either positive or negative effects of the neighboring plants.

The ash generated as a by-product of combustion, whether for heat or power generation, has potential use as a fertilizer in forest systems. This review assesses the available information on factors affecting the quality of the ash and environmental implications arising from its application. The key determinants of wood ash chemistry are the tree species combusted, the nature of the burn process and the conditions at the application site. Wood ash from hardwood species produces higher levels of macronutrients in their ash than conifers, and the silica content is frequently lower. A furnace temperature between 500 and 900 degrees C is critical to the retention of nutrients, particularly potassium, and determines the concentrations of potentially toxic metals including aluminium in the ash. Fly ash, the lightest component that accumulates in the flue system, can contain high concentrations of cadmium, copper, chromium, lead and arsenic and this ash should not be used as fertilizer. The form of the ash at application is important, with loose ash releasing Ca, K and Na more rapidly than granulated ash. Heavy metal, radionuclide and dioxin contamination of wood ash-based fertilizers is minimal and unlikely to affect ecosystem function. The effects of wood ash are primarily governed by application rate and soil type. The benefits are maximized at low dose rates, with possible toxicity from applications in excess of 10 t ha(-1). For most forest sites, a single wood ash application per rotation could replace all the nutrients lost after whole-tree harvesting (excepting N). Long-lasting positive effects on tree growth have been observed on shallow peats, in which the humus is slowly mineralized in response to elevated pH and increased nutrient availability. In contrast, wood ash application to podzols is only effective in enhancing tree growth when nitrogen availability is non-limiting. To date, published research of wood ash effects on trees growing in clays and loams is minimal. A lag time for positive tree responses to wood ash application is often observed, and may be the result of phosphorous limitation at higher soil pH. The greatest reported adverse ecological effects are to acidophilic ecosystems, particularly the constituent bryophyte, soil bacteria and ectomycorrhizal communities.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"wood ash use in forestry  a review of the environmental impacts"

Microclimatic conditions change considerably after forest fires. After the fires, the natural dynamics of forest, in terms of regeneration of plants and butterfly communities was set back to an earlier development phase where there were no more trees, only 2.5% of saplings survived and all saplings shorter than 5 m died. The butterfly community in the burned area had high densities of pioneer species associated with disturbed habitats. The species richness, density and height of seedlings were significantly greater in unburned forest but their growth was significantly greater in burned forest. Cuttings grown in sandy loam showed a stronger and faster growth than the cuttings in sandy clay loam and loam. Pasteurized soil media increased the growth of seedlings in the nursery. Shorea leprosula proved to be very homogenous as expressed from the similarities in frequencies of the band patterns. In the established dipterocarp nursery, the spores of mycorrhizal fungi inoculated seedlings easily and freely. In 15 months in the greenhouse, all seedlings were colonized by mycorrhizal weed fungi dominated by Laccaria sp. Even though the growth of S. leprosula seedlings in the nursery was supported by initial inoculation, in the field, no initial inoculation seedlings showed a stronger growth because they benefited more from the late stage fungi infecting plants at the location.

Whereas alterations to aboveground ecosystems have been extensively studied, little is known about soil fungal responses in fire-adapted ecosystems. We implement a chronosequence of four different fires that varied in time since fire, 2 years (2015) to 11 years (2006) and contained stands of high severity burned P. ponderosa in eastern Washington and compared their soil fungal communities to adjacent unburned plots. Using Illumina Miseq (ITS1), we examined changes in soil nutrients, drivers of species richness for ectomycorrhizal (plant symbionts) and saprobic (decomposers) fungi, community shifts, and post-fire fungal succession in burned and unburned plots. Ectomycorrhizal richness was 43.4% and sapmbic richness 12.2% lower in the burned plots, leading to long-term alterations to the fungal communities that did not return to unburned levels, even after 11 years. Differences in the post-fire fungal community were driven by pyrophilous, ""fire-loving"" fungi, including the ectomycorrhizal Ascomycete genera Pustularia and Wilcoxina, and the saprobic Basidiomycete genus Geminibasidium. Ectomycorrhizal and sapmbic fungi were intimately linked to the soil environment: depth of the organic matter, total carbon, total nitrogen, and their interaction with fire predicted ectomycorrhizal richness. Whereas total carbon, time since fire, treatment, and the interaction between time since fire and treatment predicted saprobic richness. We conclude that high-severity wildfires lead to lower ectomycorrhizal richness and significantly altered ectomycorrhizal and saprobic communities in fire-adapted ecosystems, selecting resilient and fire-adapted species, such as W. rehmii and Geminibasidium sp., thus initiating post-fire succession.","YES",NA,"YES","YES","Article",NA,"YES",NA,NA,"USA","highseverity wildfire reduces richness and alters composition of ectomycorrhizal fungi in lowseverity adapted ponderosa pine forests"

We then used fourth-corner analysis to examine the influence of a wider set of fragmentation-related factors on trait abundances.Results: The functional composition and diversity of Banksia woodlands changed with remnant age, particularly in the smaller remnants. Plants more prone to decline with remnant age were the growth form shrubs, root-clustered trees, herbaceous obligate seeders and understorey species that are insect-pollinated, have seeds dispersal internally by animals and have arbuscular or ericoid mycorrhizas. In contrast, plants more prone to persist were growth forms trees, sedges and rushes, ectomycorrhizal trees, herbaceous resprouters, wind-pollinated and root-clustered understorey species. FD increased with remnant age in the growth forms and overstorey, but declined among the herbaceous and shrub pollination and nutrient acquisition traits.Conclusions: Functional traits that consistently signalled the plant community response to fragmentation were growth form, pollination and dispersal. This functional response was largely delayed, suggesting a functional extinction debt, which will lead to a further decline of plants with vulnerable trait states in the future, especially in the small- and medium-sized remnants. Our study illustrates the vulnerability of small remnants to changes in community assembly and ecosystem function due to fragmentation. Furthermore, it exemplifies how a functional trait approach is valuable to understand the impacts of urbanization on remnant plant communities, before local extinctions may occur.

Such burns may have dramatic effects on the soil microbial communities. In this study, we utilized experimental infrastructure in the Pringle Falls Experimental Forest in Oregon, where ten pairs of sites were assigned to either high burn (HB) or low burn (LB) intensity treatments to examine fungal community responses. In these treatments, understory shrubs and logging debris were masticated and broadcast burned (LB) or piled logs were fully combusted (HB) in a paired design. The burn treatments generated soil temperatures of similar to 100 degrees C (LB) or up to 700 degrees C (HB) at the soil surface. We sampled soils (0-10 cm) one week before and three weeks after ignition and Illumina MiSeq-analyzed fungal Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 (ITS1) PCR-amplicons to deeply dissect the fungal communities. Our data indicate dramatic and rapid responses in community diversity and evenness in the HB treatment, with similar responses, but to a lesser degree, in the LB treatment. Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) ordinations and analyses of taxon frequencies reveal a substantial community turnover and corresponding replacement of the dominant basidiomycetes by ascomycetes in the HB treatment. Similar trends were visible, but weaker in the LB treatments. These coarse-level taxonomic responses were attributable to a few fire-responsive fungi, particularly Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) assigned to Pyronema sp. and Morchella sp., whose frequencies increased more than 100-fold following the HB treatment. Our study highlights the strong and rapid fungal fire responses and differences among fires of different intensities. As the high intensity fires - such as those represented here by the HB treatment - tend to be spatially confined and limited in scale, we emphasize their potential to generate distinct patches that may substantially contribute to beta diversity on small scales. Further, these data lead to questions about fungal community recovery (return to community state preceding the fire) and the importance of patch dynamics following a fire as well as function of post-fire communities and ecosystem services that they may provide.

We previously identified a 50-year time series of burn scars created after clear cut harvesting in lodgepole pine stands where we reported sparse tree colonization across the entire chronosequence. Here we analyzed soil nutrients and chemistry and conducted in situ and greenhouse seedling bioassays to determine whether edaphic factors or poor seedling performance explain the pattern. Pile burning had a lasting effect on soil pH, but nutrient availability was 2?3 times higher in burn scars compared to unburned forest soils for many constituents and planted pine seedlings had good survival and growth. However, seedling growth was slightly less in burn scars compared to unburned soils indicating suboptimal soil pH or other belowground factors may contribute to sparse tree colonization of the openings. For example, seedling survival and ectomycorrhizal fungi colonization were both lowest in the most recently created scars where soils were alkaline and improved with time as pH declined, suggesting gradual amelioration of post-fire growing conditions. Survival in burn scars was comparable for unprotected trees and those in protective mesh tubes, indicating that herbivory was not a significant impediment to seedling establishment. However, a preliminary study suggests that seed predation may have contributed to the low tree colonization into the openings.

Pine roots were collected, and EM fungi characterized by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and the large subunit (LSU) regions of the nuclear ribosomal (nr)-DNA. The effects of the elapsed time after fire on the EM community structure (richness, presence/absence of fungi, phylogenetic diversity) and on soil properties were analysed.Fungal richness decreased with the elapsed time since the fire; although, the phylogenetic diversity of the EM community increased. Soil properties were different depending on the elapsed time after fire and particularly, the organic matter, carbon-to-nitrogen (C/N) ratio, nitrogen and iron significantly correlated with the assemblage of fungal species. Ascomycetes, particularly Tuberaceae and Pezizales, were significantly over-represented on saplings in the burned site.

To test whether soil transfers can mitigate disturbance-mediated impacts on ectomycorrhizal fungal (EMF) communities, we transferred soils containing fungal inoculum collected from conspecific late-successional forests into stands disturbed by wildfire, mountain pine beetle outbreak, clear-cut logging or salvage logging. Afterward, lodgepole pine seeds were sown to measure germination, establishment and growth of seedlings, and to characterize root-associated and soil EMF communities by sequencing the ITS1 rDNA region. Despite evidence that soil inocula contained viable EMF communities, transfers did not impact the root-associated or soil EMF community composition, or seed germination, seedling establishment and growth. Resident EMF community composition remained unchanged upon transfers of fungi from late-stage successional forests, and disturbance type singularly explained the EMF community composition associated with roots and soils.

Beeches form persistent stands at high elevations, but their establishment on lowland sites depends mainly on catastrophic disturbances. In New Zealand, nearly all studies of beech forest dynamics to date have reported all-sized, persistent populations. However, previous work has focused largely on the South Island or on North Island mountains, where beeches are widespread and often dominant. Little is known about beech dynamics in the warm North Island lowlands, where beeches are less common. We aimed to clarify the circumstances that enable beeches to establish on lowland sites in the North Island. We measured population structures of beeches and associated species on 11 plots distributed across a range of climate, lithology and topography. On sites where the most shade-tolerant broadleaved trees were absent or uncommon, all-sized populations showed that beech regeneration did not depend on major disturbances. These stands were located mostly on steep faces or ridges with soil carbon:nitrogen ratios > 18, usually with ericaceous understoreys. On sites with higher N availability, where shade-tolerant broadleaved trees were abundant, beech populations were generally sparser, with restricted age ranges. One of these +/- even-aged beech stands appeared to have established after windthrow, the other four after fires. Recent dieback of Weinmannia racemosa associated with insect attack had resulted in another wave of beech regeneration in one of the post-fire stands. Establishment on landslides appears to only rarely enable beeches to capture new sites in the lowland North Island. We conclude that beeches form stable self-replacing stands on lowland North Island sites with low nitrogen availability, but that exogenous disturbances occasionally enable beeches to establish as pioneers on sites with higher nitrogen availability. The early successionalrole commonly seen in lowland south-central Chile thus appears less widespread in New Zealand.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"dynamics of southern beech nothofagaceae stands in the lowland north island of new zealand"

Along the pine age gradient, some ECM fungal taxa were gradually being replaced with others. Additionally, a shift in functionality (i.e. exploration type community structure) was observed.

Such changes have modified forest environments but the effects of these changes on macrofungi are still unclear. This thesis examines macrofungal communities in boreal forests and peatlands, with particular focus on the effects of wildfire, prescribed burning and tree retention (timber harvest intensity) on ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and saprotrophic (SM) macrofungi (Basidiomycota and Ascomycota). The thesis is based on empirical field data, which includes over 550 species and a monitoring period of up to 12 years. Fertile forests had more diverse ECM and SM assemblages than the dry and semi-dry forests. Non-ditched pine bogs had less macrofungi than drained spruce mires, pine mires and pine bogs. Rare and Red-listed agarics and aphyllophoroid wood-associated macrofungal species were rare in managed forests. In general, wildfire increased the richness and sporocarp production of several SM species and also modified assemblage composition. ECM diversity was greatest in the mild and intermediate fire sites where it was three-fold higher than the high-severity fire sites. The succession of fire-associated pyrophilous species in burned humus was rapid. Prescribed burning and harvest intensity had a major influence on macrofungal populations. However, these effects were strongly dependent on the functional group. Clear-cut areas had an overall adverse effect on macrofungi; ECM species in particular disappeared after clear-cutting. Several SM species occurred exclusively on burned areas, and retention areas had a slight positive effect on macrofungi, including ECM species. My results show that macrofungal assemblages are diverse and vary systematically in forest and peatland site types. Intensive forest management has mostly negative effects on macrofungi, including edible mushroom species. Prescribed fire in the forest landscape and a reduction in harvest intensity can be used to maintain fungal assemblage diversity in managed forests.","YES",NA,"NO","YES","PhD Thesis",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"the structure of macrofungal assemblages in boreal forests with particular reference to the effect of fire on basidiomycota and ascomycota"

Ectomycorrhizal macrofungi (ECM) is a key below-ground ecological group, mainly because of their functional relationships to trees. During severe fire disturbances, below-ground mycelia of ECM may be negatively affected. This study analyses long-term effects of a wildfire on ECM assemblages.Using data from 12-years post-fire succession of ECM, we investigated the long-term fire effects on ECM, focusing on the effects of spatial variability in fire severity. The wildfire occurred in 1992 in eastern Finland, and covered 143 ha. We established sampling plots to four types of sites within the burned area, based on the observed fire severity, and also on unburned control sites. ECM assemblages were surveyed every autumn during the following 12 years period. A total of 133 ECM species and 14 469 ECM sporocarps were sampled.Fire severity was closely associated with the post-fire ECM richness and assemblage patterns. The highest overall ECM species richness was in the low severity surface fire area, 87 species in total, followed by the intermediate ground fire area, 72 species; they both included post-disturbance ECM pioneer species but also species that are usually associated with old-growth forests. The high-severity crown fire area comprised only 15 ECM species and the high-severity treeless ground fire area 23 species. Assemblage composition (based on NMDS) was different in the two most severely burned areas, in comparison to less severely burned areas and controls.We conclude that fire affects ECM assemblages and that the severity of a wildfire is connected to post-fire patterns of ECM richness and composition. The results suggest a functional link between wildfire and post-fire tree growth, mediated through the effects of fire on ECM. These connections may be important in maintaining small-scale, within-stand spatial heterogeneity in the natural post-disturbance forests.","YES",NA,"YES","YES","Article",NA,"YES",NA,NA,"Finland","severity of forest wildfire had a major influence on early successional ectomycorrhizal macrofungi assemblages including edible mushrooms"

To study the presence and abundance of T. melanosporum ectomycorrhizas in plantations, two sampling methods, direct sampling of root tips and soil core collection, are compared by analyzing 48 evergreen oak trees (Quercus ilex) inoculated with truffle.

Direct sampling of root tips and soil core collection were equally effective in detecting this species, although soil core collection proved a better method to also evaluate ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity.

These ecosystems are also associated with large and diverse fungal communities. These fungal communities play essential ecological roles for the survival of vascular plant, such as the mineral and water uptaking or resistance against pathogens carried out by mycorrhizal fungi, as the saprotrophic fungi are a key factor for the recycling of the dead matter. In addition, edible fungi, such as Boletus edulis, provide a source of income for the nearby rural population. Fuel reduction treatments are applied to reduce the risk of wildfire; however, their potential impact on fungal communities is unclear. Thus, the aim of this work was to investigate the effect of different fuel reduction treatments on fungi associated with Quercus and Cistus. This aim is accompanied by the management-driven objective to obtain data from fuel reduction treatments that will enable managers to find solutions with a balanced approach to maintaining productive areas of edible mushroom production while reducing fire risks across the landscape. Sporocarps were sampled over a five-year period in stands dominated by mature or coppiced Quercus pyrenaica and accompanied by Cistus ladanifer understory. These stands had been subjected to different fuel reduction treatment levels involving moderate-or high-intensity thinning, for Q. pyrenaica, or clearing, for C. ladanifer. The goal was to determine sporocarp production, species richness, and taxonomic composition. Sporocarp production and fungal richness were drastically affected by the fuel reduction treatments but only when C. ladanifer is included in the treatment. Taxa composition was strongly correlated with the treatments applied to the rockrose under story. This was probably due to the large range of associated ectomycorrhizal fungi of C. ladanifer and their high capacity to recolonize an area after disturbances. Based on our results, we conclude that the implementation of moderate-/high-intensity fuel reduction treatments is compatible with the conservation of the fungal community present in these systems. In addition, the creation of a multi-stage mosaic of stands through mechanical management could enable fire prevention to be managed in an effective way while maintaining fungal diversity and sporocarp production, favoring the use of non-wood resources in rural areas and conserving a healthier forest ecosystem.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"effects of fuel reduction treatments on the sporocarp production and richness of a<i> quercuscistus<i> mixed system"

In the Himalayas, collection of firewood, tree leaf fodder, and leaf litter from forest floor is one of the main causes of forest degradation, particularly in oak (Quercus leucotrichophora) and pine (Pinus roxburghii) elevation belt (1000-2200 m elevation) of the Western and Central Himalayas. In this area, whole tree cutting is uncommon, but most trees are lopped until they become severely denuded, with little crown left. Compared to healthy forests, generally such degraded forests have 40-50% less biomass but about 80% less net primary productivity and 86.4% less leaf area. As degradation progresses, the biomass extracted from the forest declines, but in proportional terms it increases, resulting in a rapid disintegration of ecosystem structure and functions. Some of the observed effects are (1) reduction of soil carbon and nitrogen by 40-50%; (2) desiccation of oak acorns lying on forest floor well before the arrival of monsoon; (3) about 40% reduction in leaf litter decomposition; (4) 35% reduction in ectomycorrhizal association with roots, as indicated by fungal sporocarp density; and (5) 25% reduction in soil water holding capacity and 25% increase in soil bulk density (these values are in comparison to a relatively undisturbed forest).

Some plants and ecosystem types are threatened by increasing fire pressure while others respond positively to fire, growing in local and regional abundance when it occurs regularly. However, quantifying total ecosystem response to fire demands consideration of impacts not only on aboveground vegetation, but also on soil microbes like fungi, which influence decomposition and nutrient mineralization. If fire-resistant soil fungal communities co-occur with similarly adapted plants, these above- and belowground ecosystem components should shift and recover in relative synchrony after burning. If not, fire might decouple ecosystem processes governed by these different communities, affecting total functioning. Here, we use a natural experiment to test whether fire-dependent ecosystems host unique, fire-resistant fungal communities. We surveyed burned and unburned areas across two California ecosystem types with differing fire ecologies in the immediate aftermath of a wildfire, finding that the soil fungal communities of fire-dependent oak woodlands differ from those of neighbouring mixed evergreen forests. We discovered furthermore that the latter are more strongly altered compositionally by fire than the former, suggesting that differences in fungal community structure support divergent community responses to fire across ecosystems.

Forest tree seedlings, which could otherwise encroach and overgrow woodlands, are killed by regular fire, yet fire has other effects that may also influence these feedbacks. In particular, many forest trees require symbiotic ectomycorrhizal fungi in order to establish. By restructuring soil fungal communities, fire might affect the availability of symbionts or the potential for symbiont sharing between encroaching trees and woodland vegetation.To investigate this possibility, we performed a soil bioassay experiment using inoculum from burned and unburned oak woodlands and Douglas-fir forests. We examined how fire, ecosystem type, and neighboring heterospecific seedlings affect fungal root community assembly of Douglas-firs and oaks. We asked whether heterospecific seedlings facilitated fungal colonization of seedling roots in non-native soil, and if so, whether fire influenced this interaction.External fungal colonization of oak roots was more influenced by fire and ecosystem type than by the presence of a Douglas-fir, and oaks increased the likelihood that Douglas-fir roots would be colonized by fungi in oak woodland soil. Yet, fire increased colonization of Douglas-fir in oak soil, diminishing the otherwise crucial role played by oak facilitation. Fire also strengthened the positive effect of Douglas-firs on oak root-associated fungal diversity in Douglas-fir forest soil.Prior work shows that fire supports woodland ecosystems by stemming recruitment of encroaching seedlings. Here, we find evidence that it may contrastingly reduce fungal limitation of invasive seedling growth and establishment, otherwise relieved only by facilitation.

The response of EMF species richness, live fine root biomass and duff levels to various forms and combinations of thinning and burning was investigated in mixed ponderosa pine and Douglas fir stands in the Blue Mountains of Oregon. The below-ground community composition and structure of EMF at the site was characterized using molecular methods.3. The EMF community consisted of a large number of infrequently detected species. The distribution of a few abundant species (Cenococcum sp., Piloderma sp., Rhizopogon salebrosus and Wilcoxina rehmii) in a majority of the treatments both before and after treatment application demonstrates that some EMF species survive or rapidly re-establish after disturbance.4.

The loss occurred when the mycorrhizal fungus experienced a sudden increase in nitrogen supply.

We then build upon existing literature to identify the most important mechanisms that control postfire N availability in systems experiencing severe, stand-replacing fires compared with fires of lower severity. These mechanisms include changes in abiotic conditions caused by the opening of the canopy (for example, decreased LAI, increased solar radiation), changes in ground layer quantity and quality (for example, nutrient release, permafrost levels), and postfire plant and microbial adaptations affecting N fixation and N uptake (for example, serotiny, germination cues). Based on the available literature, these mechanisms appear to affect N inputs, internal N cycling, and N outputs in various ways, indicating that severe fire systems are variable across time and space as a result of complex interactions between postfire abiotic and biotic factors.

Despite this obligate dependence, there are gaps in the identification of ECMF that associate with WBP. In addition, ECMF rarely feature in assessments of recovery actions and little is known about the relationship between ECMF and the insects and pathogens affecting WBP. We used next-generation sequencing to characterize ECMF occurring in soil and mycorrhizal root tip samples from naturally occurring mature WBP trees and seedlings as well as planted WBP seedlings in the Columbia Mountains of Interior British Columbia, Canada. ECMF data was paired with data on tree age, tree health and soil conditions. Thirty-three species and twenty-one genera of ECMF were identified with medium or high confidence from mycorrhizal root tip samples. Major groups were: generalist ascomycetes [Cenococcum, Meliniomyces (=Hyaloscypha)], Atheliales (Piloderma, Amphinema, Tylospora), non-ascomycetous generalists (e.g., Amphinema), associates of high-elevation conifers (species of Cortinarius, Russula) and Suilloids (Suillus, Rhizopogon). Differences in WBP ECMF with other, drier and southerly regions that have been studied previously, were consistent with a distinct forest type and an endemism hypothesis. Soil at the planting site and planted seedlings hosted a reduced ECMF community or were non-ectomycorrhizal, which can be explained by site factors and is expected to affect seedling survival. ECMF composition on mature trees was correlated with tree health, which may have implications for WBPs resistance to pathogens and signals that ECMF are affected by the decline of their host. Understanding the ecology of WBP ECMF and their relationship with tree performance is essential for WBP recovery efforts.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"characterizing the ectomycorrhizal fungal community of whitebark pine in interior british columbia mature trees natural regeneration and planted seedlings"

We treated blocks with mechanical mastication only, mechanical mastication followed by prescribed fire, prescribed fire only, and no treatment. Five years after the prescribed burn, soils with ectomycorrhizal roots were sampled at the canopy dripline of Pinus attenuata and Quercus kelloggii and surveyed for truffles. Ectomycorrhizae and truffles were described by morphology and by DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region. Ectomycorrhizal communities did not differ among treatments.

Functional diversity is now advocated as a keymetric for restoration success, yet it has received little analytical attention to date. We conducted a meta-analysis of 90 studies that measured differences in species richness for functional groups of fungi, lichens, and beetles between old-growth control and planted or secondary treatment forests in temperate, boreal, and Mediterranean regions. We identified functional-group-specific relationships in the response of species richness to stand age after forest disturbance.

We quantified ECM fungi diversity and abundance from 255 soil cores from stunted, released, and normally growing black spruce seedlings sampled in two Kalmia-dominated sites in Newfoundland.

The eastern bettong (Bettongia gaimardi) and the long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridactylus) are mycophagous marsupials regarded as both keystone species and ecosystem engineers. Despite Tasmania being a refuge for these declining species, their niche partitioning is poorly understood. Aims. Our aim was to identify factors that distinguish the distributions of B. gaimardi and P. tridactylus, and to develop a better explanation of their individual niches. Methods. The Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment conducted mammal surveys between 1975 and 2019. We used GIS to analyse these data, and geospatial information to identify relationships between B. gaimardi and P. tridactylus presence/absence and environmental variables. We then developed a model describing the distributions of these species in Tasmania. Key results. Temperature seasonality (s.d. x 100), precipitation of wettest month (mm), precipitation of the driest month (mm), precipitation seasonality (coefficient of variation), the presence of vegetation dominated by Eucalyptus amygdalina and the presence of lowland grassy woodland/forest were the components in the best model for B. gaimardi. Our model broadly predicts that the distribution of B. gaimardi is restricted to the more fertile eastern half of Tasmania. P. tridactylus was associated with very few variables, with the presence of E. amygdalina-Eucalyptus obliqua damp forest being the only component in a very weak model. Transects with P. tridactylus and not B. gaimardi were more associated with rainforest and wet forest communities and areas of higher annual and wettest-month precipitation than were those with B. gaimardi and not P. tridactylus. Conclusions. The importance of infertile sites to B. gaimardi may have been overstated in the literature, with moderate to high fertility being more characteristic of its range. B. gaimardi is adapted to persist in environments of low truffle (food) density, typical of the eastern half of Tasmania, through its ability to adopt a larger home range than for P. tridactylus, which requires dense ground vegetation. Implications. Sites of high fertility in fragmented landscapes should be considered to be potential habitat for B. gaimardi. This challenges previous assumptions that infertile sites are the primary habitat of the species, with fertile sites offering poorer-quality habitat.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"identifying important environmental variables in the niche partitioning of two keystone ecosystem engineers <i>bettongia gaimardi<i> and <i>potorous tridactylus<i> in tasmania"

Ectomycorrhizas were sampled within 1 m(2) plots before and one year after the fire, and in nearby control plots that were not burned. The cores were divided into litter/organic, upper mineral, and lower mineral layers. The total ectomycorrhizal biomass in the control plots did not differ between year one and rear two samples for any core layer, while in the fire plots the destruction of the litter/organic layer resulted in an eight-fold reduction in total ectomycorrhizal biomass. Mycorrhizal biomass in the two mineral layers was not significantly reduced by the fire. We used molecular tools to identify fungi directly from the ectomycorrhizas. In unburned plots members of the Russulaceae and Thelephoraceae were among the most frequent and abundant ectomycorrhizal types; species of most other taxa were rare. In the control plots these two families were among the dominant species in both years, but patchiness on a fine spatio-temporal scale caused some major changes in ranking of individual species between sample years. Rhizopogon subcaerulescens was the most pronounced example: its biomass in the control plot samples was seven times greater in year two than in year one because of an exceptionally large cluster of mycorrhizas encountered in a single core. The effect of fire on individual species was difficult to assess because of this patchiness and because all species were low in abundance after the fire. The most abundant pre-fire species were reduced to undetectable post-fire levels, while several less abundant species, including R. subcaerulescens, Cenococcum geophilum, and several unknown types were not substantially reduced by the fire. We speculate that the more abundant species, Martellia sp., thelephoroid 1, and Tomentella sublilacina, were differentially affected because their dominance was most prominent at the litter and organic layers.

Mean shoot nitrate reductase activities were high for all species in recently burnt sites and showed little increase when nitrate was supplied via the transpiration stream. Nitrate reductase of shoots of most species was low at sites not burnt for several years, but following transpirational induction with nitrate, developed activities similar to those at recently burnt sites. The principal amino compounds transported in the xylem were species specific, including asparagine, glutamine and citrulline-dominated species, and changed little in relative composition across the chronosequence. Species most active in leaf nitrate reduction transported the largest amounts of nitrate in their xylem sap and proportional amounts of nitrate in xylem tended to be greatest in recently burnt sites. Most of the species examined appeared to be shoot rather than root nitrate assimilators, but marked differences were recorded in potential of leafy shoots of different species to reduce nitrate. As a general rule, shallow-rooted herbaceous, non-mycorrhizal or VAM-positive species had the highest capacity to reduce nitrate, whereas woody species with ericoid mycorrhizae or combined vesicular arbuscular/ectomycorrhizal associations exhibited little capacity to reduce nitrate in roots or shoots.

We reveal that a low number of field studies (73) directly address fire effect on ECM symbiosis, in a restricted geographic area that partially represents the geography of ECM biodiversity stakes and fire risk. The analyzed literature consensually reports long-term shifts in the composition of ECM fungal communities after fire. Contrastingly, the effects of fire on fungal diversity and richness at the local scale continue to be debated among researchers, and need to be documented further using adequate experimental device to limit the effects of some identified methodological biases.

Communities from consecutive summers were not significantly different, indicating that interannual variation was small in relation to differences between forest types and soil horizons, yet the community at a seasonal study site underwent significant changes within a year. In each study, mycorrhizal fungi dominated the community. Fungi rather than bacteria appeared to dominate [(13)C] cellulose degradation, with strongest growth in taxa that were not dominant members of the untreated community, including members of the genus Sebacina. Overall, our results point to considerable interannual resilience juxtaposed with narrow niche partitioning and the capacity of individual taxa in these hyperdiverse communities to respond strongly to resource inputs and changes in other abiotic environmental parameters such as temperature.

The below-ground fungal community found in the mature forest contrasted markedly with the resistant propagule community, as only four species were found in both communities. The dominant species in the mature forest were members of the Russulaceae, Thelephorales and Amanitaceae. In contrast, the resistant propagule community was dominated by Rhizopogon species and by species of the Ascomycota. Only one species, Tomentella sublilacina (Thelephorales), was common in both communities. The spatial distribution of mycorrhizae on mature roots and propagules in the soil differed among the dominant species, For example, T. sublilacina mycorrhizae exhibited a unique bias toward the organic horizons, Russula brevipes mycorrhizae were denser and more clumped than those of other species and Cenococcum propagules were localized, whereas R. subcaerulescens propagules were evenly distributed.

Using Maryland serpentine barrens and an Ohio alkaline prairie complex as model systems, we tested the hypothesis that the invasiveness of Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana L.) into such communities is regulated by the spatial pattern of ECM fungal inoculum in the soil. ECM colonization of pine seedlings can occur by (1) hyphae growing from the roots of mature ECM pines colonizing nearby seedlings (contagion model), (2) pine seedlings being infected after germinating in open areas where spores are concentrated in feces of animals that have consumed sporocarps (centers of infection model), and (3) colonization from spores that are wind-dispersed across the landscape (background model). To test these models of dispersal of ECM fungal inoculum into these barrens, we used autocorrelation and spatially explicit mapping techniques (semivariance analysis and kriging) to characterize the distribution and abundance of ECM inoculum in soil. Our results strongly suggest that ECM fungi most often disperse into open barrens by contagion, thereby facilitating rapid pine colonization in an advancing front from mature pine forests bordering the barrens. Spatial patterns consistent with the centers of infection model were present but less common. Thus, current management techniques that rely on cutting and fire to reverse pine invasion may be ineffective because they do not kill or disrupt hyphal mats attached to mature roots of neighboring pines.

A controversial hypothesis that prescribed burning increases fruiting of certain hypogeous fungi based on observations in Tasmania was tested in the Australian Capital Territory to determine if it applied in a quite different habitat. Ten pairs of plots, burnt and nonburnt, were established at each of two sites prescribe-burnt in May 1999. When sampled in early July, after autumn rains had initiated the fungal fruiting season, species richness and numbers of fruit bodies on the burnt plots were extremely low: most plots produced none at all. Both species richness and fruit body numbers were simultaneously high on nonburnt plots. one of the sites was resampled a year after the initial sampling. At that time species richness and fruit body abundance were still significantly less on burnt plots than on nonburnt, but a strong trend towards fungal recovery on the burnt plots was evident. This was particularly so when numbers of fruit bodies of one species, the hypogeous agaric Dermocybe globuliformis, were removed from the analysis. This species strongly dominated the nonburnt plots but was absent from burnt plots in both years. The trend towards recovery of fruit body abundance in the burnt plots one year after the burn was much more pronounced with exclusion of the Dermocybe data. The Tasmanian-based hypothesis was based mostly on the fruiting of two fire-adapted species in the Mesophelliaceae. Neither species occurred on our plots. Accordingly, the results and conclusions of the Tasmanian study cannot be extrapolated to other habitats without extensive additional study.

Mycorrhizal tissue has been estimated to comprise a significant fraction of soil organic matter and below-ground biomass in a range of systems. The current body of literature indicates that in many systems exposed to elevated CO2, mycorrhizal fungi might sequester increased amounts of C in living, dead and residual hyphal biomass in the soil. Through this process, the fungi might serve as a negative feedback on the rise in atmospheric CO2 levels caused by fossil fuel burning and deforestation. By contrast, a few preliminary studies suggest that N deposition might increase turnover rates of fungal tissue and negate CO2 effects on hyphal biomass. If these latter responses are consistent among ecosystems, C storage in hyphae might decline in habitats surrounding agricultural and urban areas. When N additions occur without CO2 enrichment, effects on mycorrhizal growth are inconsistent. We note that analyses of hyphal decomposition under elevated CO2 and N additions are extremely sparse but are critical in our understanding of the impact of global change on the cycling of mycorrhizal C. Finally, shifts in the community composition of arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal fungi with increasing CO2 or N availability are frequently documented. Since mycorrhizal groups vary in growth rate and tissue quality, these changes in species assemblages could produce unforeseeable impacts on the productivity, survivorship, or decomposition of mycorrhizal biomass.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mycorrhizal fungi have a potential role in soil carbon storage under elevated co<sub>2<sub> and nitrogen deposition"

We used a chronosequence in Alaska to test Read's hypothesis that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi should dominate ecosystems with low accumulation of surface litter, and ectomycorrhizal fungi should proliferate where organic horizons are well-developed. This pattern is expected because ectomycorrhizal fungi display a greater capacity to mineralize organic compounds than do arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The sites were located in upland forests near Delta Junction, Alaska, and represent stages at 3, 15, 45, and 80 years following fire. Soil organic matter accumulated 2.8-fold over time. Fire did not noticeably reduce the abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In contrast, ectomycorrhizal colonization required up to 15 years to return to pre-fire levels. As a result, dominant mycorrhizal groups shifted from arbuscular to ectomycorrhizal fungi as succession progressed. Bacterial functional diversity was greatest in the oldest sites. Altogether, microbes that can mineralize organic compounds (i.e., ectomycorrhizae and bacteria) recovered more slowly than those that cannot (i.e., arbuscular mycorrhizae). Potential net N mineralization and standing pools of ammonium-N were relatively low in the youngest site. In addition, glomalin stocks were positively correlated with arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphal length, peaking early in the chronosequence. Our results indicate that microbial succession may influence soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics in the first several years following fire, by augmenting carbon storage in glomalin while inhibiting mineralization of organic compounds.","YES",NA,"YES","YES","Article",NA,"YES",NA,"Only approaches ECM root colonization.

Root colonization was low; less than 1% of the root length was colonized by AM and 25.6% by DSE. EM colonized 25% of the root tips and 19.4% of the root length. AM and DSE colonization were not related to distance from the present glacier terminus or to canopy cover. EM colonization increased with distance from the glacier terminus based on gridline intercept data but not on root tip frequency data. Availability of propagules in the substrate was low, but numbers of propagules increased with distance from the glacier terminus. The EM communities were dominated by three ascomycetes showing affinity to Sordariaceae in BLAST analyses. Other frequent taxa on the glacier forefront included species of Cortinariaceae, Pezizaceae, Russulaceae, Thelephoraceae and Tricholomataceae. When occurrence of individual taxa was used as a response variable to canopy cover, distance from the glacier terminus, and their interaction, four different fungal guilds were identified: 1) fungi that did not respond to these environmental variables; 2) fungi that occurred mainly in intercanopy areas and decreased with distance from the glacier terminus; 3) fungi that were insensitive to canopy cover but increased with distance from the glacier terminus; 4) fungi that occurred mainly under willow canopies and increased with distance from the glacier terminus. We suggest that fungal colonization is mainly limited by fungal propagule availability. Environmental conditions may also limit successful establishment of plant-fungus associations. We propose that the four EM guilds partly explain successional dynamics.

Host-specific fungi dominated in 5-yr-old stands, but host generalists were dominant in the oldest two age classes. ECM fungal community compositions were similar in 65- and 100-yr-old stands but differed among all other pairs of age classes.Within the age range studied, site-level ECM fungal diversity reached a plateau by the 26-yr-old age class, while community composition stabilized by the 65-yr-old class. Simple categories such as 'early stage', 'multi stage', and 'late stage' were insufficient to describe fungal species' successional patterns.

For statistical analysis, data were grouped into the following four categories: saprotrophic, mycorrhizal; edible and inedible. A total of 115 fungal taxa were collected during the four sampling periods (85 in the late and 60 in the early stage).

After fire, pyrophytic species such as Pholiota carbonaria, Peziza violacea, Rhizopogon luteolus and Rhizopogon sp. appeared. Fire strongly affected the production of fungal species in the studied area. Thus, yields in the early stage treatment were significantly lower than those observed in the late stage.

Despite the importance of fire in many natural systems, knowledge of how fire affects the relationship between hypogeous fungi and mycophagous mammals in fire-prone environments is limited. Using experimental fires, we examined consumption of hypogeous ectomycorrhizal fruit-bodies by an endangered tropical mycophagist, the northern bettong Bettongia tropica Wakefield, in north-eastern Australia.2. Fungus was the major dietary component (56%) throughout all seasons, both before and after fire. At least 35 hypogeous taxa were consumed. Number of taxa consumed during different seasons was similar, but was significantly higher on unburnt sites than on burnt sites. Similarly, diversity of taxa per faecal sample was significantly greater on unburnt sites, but also increased irrespective of fire from wet season to dry season.3. Cluster and principal component analyses were used to examine patterns in consumption of fungal taxa. The greatest differences in dietary composition were between the period immediately after fire on burnt sites (early wet season) and all other season and treatment combinations. This difference was due to increased consumption of taxa in the fire-adapted family Mesophelliaceae and reduced consumption of the genus Elaphomyces. Principal component analysis revealed two major gradients in consumption. The first accounted for 32% of total variance and described change in consumption of taxa with season. The second accounted for 24% of total variance and described change in consumption of taxa before and after fire.4. Despite taxon-specific changes in consumption of hypogeous fungi, the body condition of bettongs did not change significantly between seasons or in relation to fire, suggesting that bettongs were never compromised in their optimal fungal intake.5. Our data show that the northern bettong has a flexible response to fire and could be best thought of as a fire-adapted marsupial.

In particular, there was a significant difference in the diets of rats caught either side of the open forest-rainforest ecotone, which marks the change in fungal community from one dominated by ectomycorrhizal fungi, to a community dominated by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Movement patterns of bush rats living around the open forest-rainforest ecotone suggest that they transport fungal spores between these contrasting fungal communities. Therefore, bush rats have the potential, by way of spore dispersal, to influence the structure of vegetation communities.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mammal mycophagy and fungal spore dispersal across a steep environmental gradient in eastern australia"

Ectomycorrhizal development and number of symbionts were assessed in the forest floor and 0-20 cm deep mineral soil in 6, 41, 65 and 122-yr-old stand by conducting a macrofungal fruit body survey and examining pine root tips microscopically for mycorrhizal status and types of fungi forming the symbiosis. The majority of roots were located in the mineral soil with no substantial invasion of the forest floor except in the 122-yr-old stand. Over 90% of the jack pine root tips were mycorrhizal and the majority of fruit bodies were produced by ectomycorrhizal species, regardless of stand age. There was no decrease in ectomycorrhizal colonization of roots with stand age. Both fruit body and root assessments revealed a distinct sequence of mycorrhizal fungi with stand age consisting of early-stage fungi [Coltricia perennis (L: Fr.)

Fruit bodies of 50 species of ectomycorrhizal fungi were recorded while 39 distinct mycorrhizal types were identified on the roots. There was a significant increase in mycorrhizal-species richness between the 6 and 41-yr-old stands and this was primarily the result of partial replacement of Suillus brevipes on the 6-yr-old trees by late-stage fungi in the older stands. Very few species present in the 6-yr-old stand were completely replaced in the older stands; rather, the multi-stage species present in the young stand were joined by late-stage species in the mature stands. The species abundance distribution of fungi on the roots in the 6-yr old stand was best described by a geometric series which is typical of an early successional community while the distributions in the three oldest stands conformed to a lognormal series which is indicative of a stable, species rich community.

After intense wildfire, decomposer and EM fungi associated with the forest floor are virtually eliminated since the organic matter may be almost completely combusted exposing the underlying mineral soil. Clearcutting and site scarification may compress and redistribute forest floor organic matter, but losses are low relative to those from intense wildfire. Studies in lodgepole and jack pine forests in Alberta indicate that wildfire destabilizes the EM community to a greater extent than clearcutting and recovery to pre-disturbance conditions is more rapid following clearcutting. Decomposer fungi in the forest floor are significantly reduced by intense wildfire while the fungal community in the underlying mineral soil remains relatively unaltered. Composition of the decomposer fungal community in the forest floor recovers rapidly after burning while community structure requires a longer timeframe to stabilize. However, changes in the decomposer fungal community following intense wildfire has negligible repercussions on litter decomposition. Clearcutting, either with or without site preparation appears to have minimal effects on the composition and structure of decomposer fungal communities.

At the ecosystem scale, decomposition and heterotrophic respiration are strongly controlled by temperature and moisture, but we questioned whether changes in microbial biomass, activity, or community structure induced by fire might also affect these processes. We particularly wanted to understand whether postfire reductions in microbial biomass could affect rates of decomposition. Additionally, we compared the short-term effects of wildfire to the long-term effects of climate warming and permafrost decline. We compared soil microbial communities between control and recently burned soils that were located in areas with and without permafrost near Delta Junction, AK. In addition to soil physical variables, we quantified changes in microbial biomass, fungal biomass, fungal community composition, and C cycling processes (phenol oxidase enzyme activity, lignin decomposition, and microbial respiration). Five years following fire, organic surface horizons had lower microbial biomass, fungal biomass, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations compared with control soils. Reductions in soil fungi were associated with reductions in phenol oxidase activity and lignin decomposition. Effects of wildfire on microbial biomass and activity in the mineral soil were minor. Microbial community composition was affected by wildfire, but the effect was greater in nonpermafrost soils. Although the presence of permafrost increased soil moisture contents, effects on microbial biomass and activity were limited to mineral soils that showed lower fungal biomass but higher activity compared with soils without permafrost. Fungal abundance and moisture were strong predictors of phenol oxidase enzyme activity in soil. Phenol oxidase enzyme activity, in turn, was linearly related to both C-13 lignin decomposition and microbial respiration in incubation studies. Taken together, these results indicate that reductions in fungal biomass in postfire soils and lower soil moisture in nonpermafrost soils reduced the potential of soil heterotrophs to decompose soil carbon. Although in the field increased rates of microbial respiration can be observed in postfire soils due to warmer soil conditions, reductions in fungal biomass and activity may limit rates of decomposition.","YES",NA,"YES","YES","Article",NA,"NO","Off_topic","Results do not refer to fungal communities, it is more focused on enzymes","USA","interactive effects of wildfire and permafrost on microbial communities and soil processes in an alaskan black spruce forest"

Koenig (XG) is a popular plant that grows in the mangrove forest of Bali. Flavonoids, saponins, phenolics and tannins are active metabolites of this plant, which have antiinflammation, antioxidant and wound healing effects. IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha are pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the pathophysiology of the wound. Flavonoids trigger increased wound contraction and reduced the period of re-epithelialization. Re-epithelialization plays a role in wound closure. Saponins increase fibroblast migration and proliferation as indicated by the amount of high cell density. Fibroblasts support granulation tissue synthesis, ECM production, and collagen synthesis, thereby accelerating wound healing. Tannins have antibacterial activity and increase the angiogenesis. Phenolics can stimulate wound contraction, migration of fibroblasts, and re-epithelialization processes in wound healing. The present study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of XG extract seeds cream on burn wound grade IIA in mice. XG extract was evaluated for antioxidant activity using the DPPH method. The wound healing activity of XG creams (10% and 15% concentration) were evaluated from wound contraction, histological analysis of fibroblast proliferation and re-epithelialization in mice. Statistical analyses were performed with post hoc Tukey using analysis of variance and were analyzed using SPSS, Version 26. XG extract has a very strong antioxidant activity (IC50=7.939 ppm). The treatment with XGC 15% promotes significant increases in wound contraction rate (74.91%), proliferation of fibroblasts (p value = 0.521) and re-epithelialization (p value = 0.521) with SSD.

We investigated wildfire effects on soil microbial communities (bacteria and fungi) in an extreme fire season in the northwestern Canadian boreal forest, using field surveys, remote sensing, and high-throughput amplicon sequencing in upland and wetland sites. We hypothesized that vegetation community and soil pH would be the most important determinants of microbial community composition, while the effect of fire might not be significant, and found that fire occurrence, along with vegetation community, moisture regime, pH, total carbon, and soil texture are all significant predictors of soil microbial community composition. Burned communities become increasingly dissimilar to unburned communities with increasingly severe burns, and the burn severity index (an index of the fractional area of consumed organic soils and exposed mineral soils) best predicted total bacterial community composition, while whether a site was burned or not was the best predictor for fungi.

Most forests are recovering from human land use, making it critical to understand the effect of disturbance on forest recovery. Forests of the eastern United States have a long history of land use, but it is unknown whether historical disturbances have contributed to their transition from ectomycorrhizal (ECM) to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) tree dominance. Disturbance may promote nitrogen (N)-fixing trees in early succession, which can elevate soil N availability even after they die. Higher soil N availability may facilitate the competitive success of AM trees over ECM trees, but such 'N fixer founder effects' have not been empirically tested.2. Here, we analysed data from three land-use disturbances in a temperate forest historically dominated by ECM trees: selective-cutting (ranging from 0 to 52 m(2)ha(-1)), clear-cutting and agricultural abandonment. These disturbances occurred at different times, but long-term data capture 3-7 decades of forest recovery.3. We found that the AM tree fraction in contemporary forests was 2, 4, and 6-fold higher following selective-cutting, clear-cutting and agricultural abandonment, respectively, compared to forest composition in 1934. Across these disturbances we also observed an increasing abundance of the N fixer black locust immediately following disturbance. Using a simulation model parameterized by data from black locust, we estimated historical rates of symbiotic N fixation to understand the relationship between N fixation and AM dominance in individual plots. We found that N fixation was positively associated with the growth of ECM trees generally, and oak and hickory specifically, only following light selective-cutting (<12 or <18 m(2)ha(-1) basal area extraction, respectively). Following higher levels of selective-cutting and clear-cutting, N fixation was positively associated with the growth of AM trees, particularly red maple and tulip poplar. Agricultural abandonment led to AM dominance regardless of N fixation rates.4. Synthesis and applications. Our findings suggest that common land use practices and black locust, a native N fixer, can reduce the dominance of ECM trees. If N fixers are likely to proliferate following disturbance, we might maintain ECM dominance by cutting trees at low densities and by applying prescribed fire to remove N.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"forest mycorrhizal dominance depends on historical land use and nitrogenfixing trees"

The fungal species richness in the 0-5 and 5-10 cm soil layers increased with time since fire, which required at least 46 years to recover to pre-fire levels. Ascomycota in each of the soil layers in the recently burned area (3 ypf) and ericoid mycorrhizas Oidiodendron maius in the 10-30 cm soil layer in the control area were recognized as indicator taxa. The examination of functional genes revealed that the diversity of potential genes and the expression of genes related to carbon degradation (e.g. chitinase, cellobiase, exoglucanase and endoglucanase) in recently burned area increased in the surface soil, whereas, decreased in the deep soil, suggesting the fire affect the loss of carbon differently in the surface and deep soils in the early stages after fire. In conclusion, the fires significantly altered the fungal communities and functional genes related to carbon storage along the soil vertical gradients and along the post-fire chronosequence.

The whole region was affected by severe fires and subjected to soil bioengineering management practices aimed at preventing hydro-geological hazards. The reforestation was carried out using 1- or 2- year-old broadleaved trees, some of them previously infected with the ectomycorrhizal fungi Laccaria bicolor and Hebeloma crustuliniforme. The goal of the investigation is to assess the effectiveness of reforestation and the survival and vitality of the planted trees. The preliminary results obtained shows that the trees infected with L. bicolor do not exhibit the expected higher level of vitality and growth.","NO","Does not approach fire effects on ECM","NO","NA","NA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"investigation on the effectiveness of silvicultural management practices by means of ectomycorrhized and nonmycorrhized holmoaks planted in burned areas a preliminary study"
